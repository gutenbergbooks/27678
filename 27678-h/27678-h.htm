<h2>CURLY LOCKS.</h2>


<p>WHEN a little girl is six and a little boy is
six, they like pretty much the same things
and enjoy pretty much the same games. She
wears an apron, and he a jacket and trousers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
but they are both equally fond of running races,
spinning tops, flying kites, going down hill on
sleds, and making a noise in the open air. But
when the little girl gets to be eleven or twelve,
and to grow thin and long, so that every two
months a tuck has to be let down in her frocks,
then a great difference becomes visible. The
boy goes on racing and whooping and comporting
himself generally like a young colt in a
pasture; but she turns quiet and shy, cares no
longer for rough play or exercise, takes droll
little sentimental fancies into her head, and likes
best the books which make her cry. Almost all
girls have a fit of this kind some time or other
in the course of their lives; and it is rather a
good thing to have it early, for little folks get
over such attacks more easily than big ones.
Perhaps we may live to see the day when wise
mammas, going through the list of nursery diseases
which their children have had, will wind up
triumphantly with, "Mumps, measles, chicken-pox,&mdash;and
they are all over with 'Amy Herbert,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
'The Heir of Redclyffe,' and the notion
that they are going to be miserable for the rest
of their lives!"</p>

<p>Sometimes this odd change comes after an
illness when a little girl feels weak and out of
sorts, and does not know exactly what is the
matter. This is the way it came to Johnnie
Carr, a girl whom some of you who read this
are already acquainted with. She had intermittent
fever the year after her sisters Katy
and Clover came from boarding-school, and was
quite ill for several weeks. Everybody in the
house was sorry to have Johnnie sick. Katy
nursed, petted, and cosseted her in the tenderest
way. Clover brought flowers to the bedside and
read books aloud, and told Johnnie interesting
stories. Elsie cut out paper dolls for her by
dozens, painted their cheeks pink and their eyes
blue, and made for them beautiful dresses and
jackets of every color and fashion. Papa never
came in without some little present or treat in
his pocket for Johnnie. So long as she was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
bed, and all these nice things were doing for her,
Johnnie liked being ill very much, but when
she began to sit up and go down to dinner, and
the family spoke of her as almost well again,
<i>then</i> a time of unhappiness set in. The Johnnie
who got out of bed after the fever was not
the Johnnie of a month before. There were
two inches more of her for one thing, for she
had taken the opportunity to grow prodigiously,
as sick children often do. Her head ached at
times, her back felt weak, and her legs shook
when she tried to run about. All sorts of queer
and disagreeable feelings attacked her. Her
hair had fallen out during the fever so that
Papa thought it best to have it shaved close.
Katy made a pretty silk-lined cap for her to
wear, but the girls at school laughed at the cap,
and that troubled Johnnie very much. Then,
when the new hair grew, thick and soft as the
plumy down on a bird's wing, a fresh affliction
set in, for the hair came out in small round
rings all over her head, which made her look like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a baby. Elsie called her "Curly," and gradually
the others adopted the name, till at last
nobody used any other except the servants, who
still said "Miss Johnnie." It was hard to recognize
the old Johnnie, square and sturdy and
full of merry life, in poor, thin, whining Curly,
always complaining of something, who lay on
the sofa reading story-books, and begging Phil
and Dorry to let her alone, not to tease her, and
to go off and play by themselves. Her eyes
looked twice as big as usual, because her face
was so small and pale, and though she was still
a pretty child, it was in a different way from
the old prettiness. Katy and Clover were very
kind and gentle always, but Elsie sometimes
lost patience entirely, and the boys openly declared
that Curly was a cross-patch, and hadn't
a bit of fun left in her.</p>

<p>One afternoon she was lying on the sofa with
the "Wide Wide World" in her hand. Her
eyelids were very red from crying over Alice's
death, but she had galloped on, and was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
reading the part where Ellen Montgomery goes
to live with her rich relatives in Scotland.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Johnnie. "How splendid
it was for her! Just think, Clover, riding
lessons, and a watch, and her uncle takes her
to see all sorts of places, and they call her their
White Rose! Oh, dear! I wish <i>we</i> had relations
in Scotland."</p>

<p>"We haven't, you know," remarked Clover,
threading her needle with a fresh bit of blue
worsted.</p>

<p>"I know it. It's too bad. Nothing ever
does happen in this stupid place. The girls in
books always do have such nice times. Ellen
could leap, and she spoke French <i>beau</i>tifully.
She learned at that place, you know, the place
where the Humphreys lived."</p>

<p>"Litchfield Co., Connecticut," said Clover
mischievously. "Katy was there last summer,
you recollect. I guess they don't <i>all</i> speak
such good French. Katy didn't notice it."</p>

<p>"Ellen did," persisted Johnnie. "Her uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and all those people were so surprised when
they heard her. Wouldn't it be grand to be
an adopted child, Clover?"</p>

<p>"To be adopted by people who gave you
your bath like a baby when you were thirteen
years old, and tapped your lips when they didn't
want you to speak, and stole your Pilgrim's
Progresses? No, thank you. I would much
rather stay as I am."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," replied Johnnie pensively. "I
don't like this place very much. I should love
to be rich and to travel in Europe."</p>

<p>At this moment Papa and Katy came in together.
Katy was laughing, and Papa looked
as if he had just bitten a smile off short. In
his hand was a letter.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clovy," began Katy, but Papa interposed
with "Katy, hold your tongue;" and
though he looked quizzical as he said it, Katy
saw that he was half in earnest, and stopped at
once.</p>

<p>"We're about to have a visitor," he went on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
picking Johnnie up and settling her in his lap,&mdash;"a
distinguished visitor. Curly, you must
put on your best manners, for she comes especially
to see you."</p>

<p>"A visitor! How nice! Who is it?" cried
Clover and Johnnie with one voice. Visitors
were rare in Burnet, and the children regarded
them always as a treat.</p>

<p>"Her name is Miss Inches,&mdash;Marion Joanna
Inches," replied Dr. Carr, glancing at the letter.
"She's a sort of godmother of yours, Curly;
you've got half her name."</p>

<p>"Was I really named after her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She and Mamma were school-friends,
and though they never met after leaving school,
Mamma was fond of her, and when little No. 4
came, she decided to call her after her old intimate.
That silver mug of yours was a present
from her."</p>

<p>"Was it? Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"At a place called Inches Mills, in Massachusetts.
She's the rich lady of the village, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
has a beautiful house and grounds, where she
lives all alone by herself. Her letter is written
at Niagara. She is going to the Mammoth Cave,
and writes to ask if it will be convenient for us
to have her stop for a few days on the way.
She wants to see her old friend's children, she
says, and especially her namesake."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Johnnie, ruffling her
short hairs with her fingers. "I wish my curls
were longer. What <i>will</i> she think when she
sees me?"</p>

<p>"She'll think</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There is a little girl, and she has a little curl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Right in the middle of her forehead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When she is good she is very, very good,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And when she is bad she is horrid&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Dr. Carr, laughing. But Johnnie didn't
laugh back. Her lip trembled, and she said,&mdash;</div>

<p>"I'm not horrid <i>really</i>, am I?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," replied her father; "you're only
a little goose now and then, and I'm such an old
gander that I don't mind that a bit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnnie smiled and was comforted. Her
thoughts turned to the coming visitor.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she'll be like the rich ladies in
story-books," she said to herself.</p>

<p>Next day Miss Inches came. Katy was an
experienced housekeeper now, and did not
worry over coming guests as once she did. The
house was always in pleasant, home-like order;
and though Debby and Alexander had fulfilled
Aunt Izzie's prediction by marrying one another,
both stayed on at Dr. Carr's and were as good
and faithful as ever, so Katy had no anxieties
as to the dinners and breakfasts. It was late in
the afternoon when the visitor arrived. Fresh
flowers filled the vases, for it was early June,
and the garden-beds were sweet with roses and
lilies of the valley. The older girls wore new
summer muslins, and Johnnie in white, her
short curls tied back with a blue ribbon, looked
unusually pretty and delicate.</p>

<p>Miss Inches, a wide-awake, handsome woman,
seemed much pleased to see them all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"So this is my name-child," she said, putting
her arm about Johnnie. "This is my little
Joanna? You're the only child I have any
share in, Joanna; I hope we shall love each
other very deeply."</p>

<p>Miss Inches' hand was large and white, with
beautiful rings on the fingers. Johnnie was
flattered at being patted by such a hand, and
cuddled affectionately to the side of her name-mamma.</p>

<p>"What eyes she has!" murmured Miss Inches
to Dr. Carr. She lowered her voice, but Johnnie
caught every word. "Such a lambent blue,
and so full of soul. She is quite different from
the rest of your daughters, Dr. Carr; don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>"She has been ill recently, and is looking
thin," replied the prosaic Papa.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't <i>that</i>! There is something else,&mdash;hard
to put into words, but I feel it! You
don't see it? Well, that only confirms a theory
of mine, that people are often blind to the qualities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of their nearest relations. We cannot get
our own families into proper perspective. It
isn't possible."</p>

<p>These fine words were lost on Johnnie, but
she understood that she was pronounced nicer
than the rest of the family. This pleased her:
she began to think that she should like Miss
Inches very much indeed.</p>

<p>Dr. Carr was not so much pleased. The note
from Miss Inches, over which he and Katy had
laughed, but which was not shown to the rest,
had prepared him for a visitor of rather high-flown
ideas, but he did not like having Johnnie
singled out as the subject of this kind of praise.
However, he said to himself, "It doesn't matter.
She means well, and jolly little Johnnie won't be
harmed by a few days of it."</p>

<p>Jolly little Johnnie would not have been
harmed, but the pale, sentimental Johnnie left
behind by the recently departed intermittent
fever, decidedly <i>was</i>. Before Miss Inches had
been four days in Burnet, Johnnie adored her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and followed her about like a shadow. Never
had anybody loved her as Miss Inches did, she
thought, or discovered such fine things in her
character. Ten long years and a half had she
lived with Papa and the children, and not one
of them had found out that her eyes were full
of soul, and an expression "of mingled mirth
and melancholy unusual in a childish face, and
more like that of <i>Goethe's Mignon</i> than any
thing else in the world of fiction!" Johnnie
had never heard of "<i>Mignon</i>," but it was delightful
to be told that she resembled her, and
she made Miss Inches a present of the whole of
her foolish little heart on the spot.</p>

<p>"Oh, if Papa would but give you to me!" exclaimed
Miss Inches one day. "If only I could
have you for my own, what a delight it would
be! My whole theory of training is so different,&mdash;you
should never waste your energies in
house-work, my darling, (Johnnie had been
dusting the parlor); it is sheer waste, with an
intelligence like yours lying fallow and only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
waiting for the master's hand. Would you
come, Johnnie, if Papa consented? Inches
Mills is a quiet place, but lovely. There are
a few bright minds in the neighborhood; we
are near Boston, and not too far from Concord.
Such a pretty room as you should have, darling,
fitted up in blue and rose-buds, or&mdash;no, Morris
green and Pompeian-red would be prettier,
perhaps. What a joy it would be to choose
pictures for it,&mdash;pictures, every one of which
should be an impulse in the best Art direction!
And how you would revel in the garden, and in
the fruit! My strawberries are the finest I
ever saw; I have two Alderney cows and quantities
of cream. Don't you think you could be
happy to come and be my own little Curly, if
Papa would consent?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Johnnie eagerly. "And I
could come home sometimes, couldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Every year," replied Miss Inches. "We'll
take such lovely journeys together, Johnnie,
and see all sorts of interesting places. Would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you like best to go to California or to Switzerland
next summer? I think, on the whole,
Switzerland would be best. I want you to
form a good French accent at once, but, above
all, to study German, the language of <i>thought</i>.
Then there is music. We might spend the
winter at <i>Stuttgard</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Decidedly Miss Inches was counting on her
chicken before hatching it, for Dr. Carr had
yet to be consulted, and he was not a parent
who enjoyed interference with his nest or nestlings.
When Miss Inches attacked him on the
subject, his first impulse was to whistle with
amazement. Next he laughed, and then he
became almost angry. Miss Inches talked very
fast, describing the fine things she would do
with Johnnie, and for her; and Dr. Carr, having
no chance to put in a word, listened patiently,
and watched his little girl, who was clinging to
her new friend and looking very eager and anxious.
He saw that her heart was set on being
"adopted," and, wise man that he was, it occurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to him that it might be well to grant
her wish in part, and let her find out by experiment
what was really the best and happiest
thing. So he did not say "No" decidedly, as
he at first meant, but took Johnnie on his knee,
and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Curly, so you want to leave Papa
and Katy and Clover, and go away to be
Miss Inches' little girl, do you?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming home to see you every single
summer," said Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Indeed! That will be nice for us," responded
Dr. Carr cheerfully. "But somehow
I don't seem to feel as if I could quite make
up my mind to give my Curly Locks away.
Perhaps in a year or two, when we are used
to being without her, I may feel differently.
Suppose, instead, we make a compromise."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Inches, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes," put in Johnnie, who had not the least
idea of what a compromise might be.</p>

<p>"I can't <i>give</i> away my little girl,&mdash;not yet,"&mdash;went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
on Dr. Carr fondly. "But if Miss Inches
likes I'll <i>lend</i> her for a little while. You may
go home with Miss Inches, Johnnie, and stay
four months,&mdash;to the first of October, let us
say." ("She'll miss two weeks' schooling, but
that's no great matter," thought Papa to himself.)
"This will give you, my dear lady, a
chance to try the experiment of having a child
in your house. Perhaps you may not like it so
well as you fancy. If you do, and if Johnnie
still prefers to remain with you, there will be
time enough then to talk over further plans.
How will this answer?"</p>

<p>Johnnie was delighted, Miss Inches not so
much so.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "it isn't so satisfactory
to have the thing left uncertain, because it
retards the regular plan of development which
I have formed for Johnnie. However, I can
allow for a parent's feelings, and I thank you
very much, Dr. Carr. I feel assured that, as
you have five other children, you will in time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
make up your mind to let me keep Johnnie entirely
as mine. It puts a new value into life,&mdash;this
chance of having an immortal intelligence
placed in my hands to train. It will be a real
delight to do so, and I flatter myself the result
will surprise you all."</p>

<p>Dr. Carr's eyes twinkled wickedly, but he
made Miss Inches the politest of bows, and said:
"You are very kind, I am sure, and I hope
Johnnie will be good and not give you much
trouble. When would you wish her visit to
commence?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;now, if you do not object. I should so
enjoy taking her with me to the Mammoth Cave,
and afterward straight home to Massachusetts.
You would like to see the Cave and the eyeless
fish, wouldn't you, darling?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Papa, yes!" cried Johnnie. Dr.
Carr was rather taken aback, but he made no
objection, and Johnnie ran off to tell the rest
of the family the news of her good fortune.</p>

<p>Their dismay cannot be described. "I really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
do think that Papa is crazy," said Clover that
night; and though Katy scolded her for using
such an expression, her own confidence in his
judgment was puzzled and shaken. She comforted
herself with a long letter to Cousin
Helen, telling her all about the affair. Elsie
cried herself to sleep three nights running, and
the boys were furious.</p>

<p>"The <i>idea</i> of such a thing," cried Dorry,
flinging himself about, while Phil put a tablespoonful
of black pepper and two spools of
thread into his cannon, and announced that if
Miss Inches dared to take Johnnie outside the
gate, he would shoot her dead, he would, just as
sure as he was alive!</p>

<p>In spite of this awful threat, Miss Inches persisted
in her plan. Johnnie's little trunk was
packed by Clover and Katy, who watered its
contents with tears as they smoothed and folded
the frocks and aprons, which looked so like
their Curly as to seem a part of herself,&mdash;their
Curly, who was so glad to leave them!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind the thick things," remarked
Dr. Carr, as Katy came through the hall with
Johnnie's winter jacket on her arm. "Put in
one warmish dress for cool days, and leave the
rest. They can be sent on <i>if</i> Johnnie decides
to stay."</p>

<p>Papa looked so droll and gave such a large
wink at the word "if," that Katy and Clover
felt their hearts lighten surprisingly, and finished
the packing in better spirits. The good-by,
however, was a sorry affair. The girls
cried; Dorry and Phil sniffed and looked fiercely
at Miss Inches; old Mary stood on the steps with
her apron thrown over her head; and Dr. Carr's
face was so grave and sad that it quite frightened
Johnnie. She cried too, and clung to Katy.
Almost she said, "I won't go," but she thought
of the eyeless fish, and didn't say it. The carriage
drove off, Miss Inches petted her, everything
was new and exciting, and before long
she was happy again, only now and then a
thought of home would come to make her lips
quiver and her eyes fill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The wonderful Cave, with its vaults and galleries
hung with glittering crystals, its underground
river and dark lake, was so like a
fairy tale, that Johnnie felt as if she <i>must</i> go
right back and tell the family at home about it.
She relieved her feelings by a long letter to
Elsie, which made them all laugh very much.
In it she said, "Ellen Montgomery didn't have
any thing half so nice as the Cave, and Mamma
Marion never taps my lips." Miss Inches, it
seemed, wished to be called "Mamma Marion."
Every mile of the journey was an enjoyment to
Johnnie. Miss Inches bought pretty presents
for her wherever they stopped: altogether, it
was quite like being some little girl taking a
beautiful excursion in a story-book, instead of
plain Johnnie Carr, and Johnnie felt that to be
an "adopted child" was every bit as nice as she
had supposed, and even nicer.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when they reached
Inches Mills, so nothing could be seen of the
house, except that it was big and had trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
around it. Johnnie went to sleep in a large
bedroom with a huge double bed all to herself,
and felt very grown-up and important.</p>

<p>The next day was given to unpacking and
seeing the grounds; after that, Miss Inches said
they must begin to lead a regular life, and Johnnie
must study. Johnnie had been to school all
winter, and in the natural course of things
would have had holidays now. Mamma Marion,
however, declared that so long an idle time
would not do at all.</p>

<p>"Education, my darling, is not a thing of
periods," she explained. "It should be like the
air, absorbed, as it were, all the time, not like a
meal, eaten just so often in the day. This idea
of teaching by paroxysms is one of the fatal
mistakes of the age."</p>

<p>So all that warm July Johnnie had French
lessons and German, and lessons in natural
philosophy, beside studying English literature
after a plan of Miss Inches' own, which combined
history and geography and geology, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
readings from various books, and accounted for
the existence of all the great geniuses of the
world, as if they had been made after a regular
recipe,&mdash;something like this:&mdash;</p>
<div class='center'>TO MAKE A POET.</div>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Take a political situation, add a rocky soil, and the
western slope of a great water-shed, pour into a mould
and garnish with laurel leaves. It will be found delicious!</p></div>

<p>The "lambent blue" of Johnnie's eyes grew
more lambent than ever as she tried to make
head and tail of this wonderful hash of people
and facts. I am afraid that Mamma Marion
was disappointed in the intelligence of her pupil,
but Johnnie did her best, though she was rather
aggrieved at being obliged to study at all in
summer, which at home was always play-time.
The children she knew were having a delightful
vacation there, and living out of doors from
morning till night.</p>

<p>As the weeks went on she felt this more and
more. Change of air was making her rosy and
fat, and with returning strength a good deal of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the old romping, hearty Johnnie came back; or
would have come, had there been anybody to
romp with. But there was nobody, for Miss
Inches scarcely ever invited children to her
house. They were brought up so poorly she
said. There was nothing inspiring in their
contact. She wanted Johnnie to be something
quite different.</p>

<p>So Johnnie seldom saw anybody except
"Mamma Marion" and her friends, who came
to drink tea and talk about "Protoplasm," and
the "Higher Education of Women," which
wasn't at all interesting to poor Curly. She
always sat by, quietly and demurely, and Miss
Inches hoped was listening and being improved,
but really she was thinking about something else,
or longing to climb a tree or have a good game
of play with real boys and girls. Once, in the
middle of a tea-party, she stole upstairs and
indulged in a hearty cry all to herself, over the
thought of a little house which she and Dorry
and Phil had built in Paradise the summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
before; a house of stumps and old boards,
lined with moss, in which they had had <i>such</i> a
good time.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as they got home, Miss Inches
sent to Boston for papers and furniture, and
devoted her spare time to fitting up a room for
her adopted child. Johnnie was not allowed to
see it till all was done, then she was led triumphantly
in. It was pretty&mdash;and queer&mdash;perhaps
queerer than pretty. The walls were
green-gray, the carpet gray-green, the furniture
pale yellow, almost white, with brass handles
and hinges, and lines of dull red tiles set into
the wood. Every picture on the walls had a
meaning, Miss Inches explained.</p>

<p>"Some of these I chose to strengthen your
mind, Johnnie, dear," she said. "These portraits,
for example. Here are Luther, Mahomet, and
Theodore Parker, three of the great Protestants
of the world. Life, to be worthy, must be
more or less of a protest always. I want you to
renumber that. This photograph is of Michael<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Angelo's Moses. I got you that too, because it
is so strong. I want you to be strong. Do you
like it?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be prettier without the
curl-papers," faltered the bewildered Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Curl-papers! My dear child, where are your
eyes? Those are horns. He wore horns as a
law-giver."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Johnnie, not daring to
ask any more questions for fear of making more
mistakes.</p>

<p>"These splendid autotypes are from the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, the glory
of the world," went on Miss Inches. "And
here, Johnnie, is the most precious of all. This
I got expressly for you. It is an education to
have such a painting as that before your eyes.
I rely very much upon its influence on you."</p>

<p>The painting represented what seemed to be
a grove of tall yellow-green sea-weeds, waving
against a strange purple sky. There was a
path between the stems of the sea-weeds, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
up this path trotted a pig, rather soft and
smudgy about his edges, as if he were running a
little into the background. His quirly tail was
smudgy also; and altogether it was more like
the ghost of a pig than a real animal, but Miss
Inches said <i>that</i> was the great beauty of the
picture.</p>

<p>Johnnie didn't care much for the painted pig,
but she liked him better than the great Reformers,
who struck her as grim and frightful;
while the very idea of going to sleep in the
room with the horned Moses scared her almost
to death. It preyed on her mind all day; and
at night, after Johnnie had gone to bed, Miss
Inches, passing the door, heard a little sob, half
strangled by the pillows. She went in.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter?" she cried.</p>

<p>"It's that awful man with horns," gasped
Johnnie, taking her head out from under the
bedclothes. "I can't go to sleep, he frightens
me so."</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, what, <i>what</i> weakness," cried
Mamma Marion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>She was too kind, however, to persist in
any plan which made Johnnie unhappy, so
Moses came down, and Johnnie was allowed to
choose a picture to fill his place. She selected a
chromo of three little girls in a swing, a dreadful
thing, all blue and red and green, which
Miss Inches almost wept over. But it was a
great comfort to Johnnie. I think it was the
chromo which put it into Mamma Marion's head
that the course of instruction chosen for her
adopted child was perhaps a little above her
years. Soon after she surprised Johnnie by the
gift of a doll, a boy doll, dressed in a suit of
Swedish gray, with pockets. In one hand the
doll carried a hammer, and under the other
arm was tucked a small portfolio.</p>

<p>"I like to make your sports a little instructive
when I can," she said, "so I have dressed
this doll in the costume of Linn&aelig;us, the great
botanist. See what a nice little herbarium he
has got under his arm. There are twenty-four
tiny specimens in it, with the Latin and English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
names of each written underneath. If you
could learn these perfectly, Johnnie, it would
give you a real start in botany, which is the
most beautiful of the sciences. Suppose you
try. What will you name your doll, darling?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Johnnie, glaring at
the wax-boy with very hostile feelings.</p>

<p>"Linn&aelig;us? No, I don't quite like to give
that name to a doll. Suppose, Johnnie, we
christen him <i>Hortus Siccus</i>. That's the Latin
name for a herbal, and will help you to remember
it when you form one of your own. Now
take him and have a good play."</p>

<p>How was it possible to have a good play with
a doll named <i>Hortus Siccus</i>? Johnnie hated
him, and could not conceal the fact. Miss Inches
was grieved and disappointed. But she
said to herself, "Perhaps she is just too old for
dolls and just too young to care for pictures.
It isn't so easy to fix a child's mental position
as I thought it would be. I must try something
else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>She really loved Johnnie and wished to make
her happy, so the thought occurred of giving
her a child's party. "I don't approve of them,"
she told her friends. "But perhaps it may be
possible to combine some instruction with the
amusements, and Johnnie is <i>so</i> pleased. Dear
little creature, she is only eleven, and small
things are great at that age. I suppose it is
always so with youth."</p>

<p>Twenty children were asked to the party.
They were to come at four, play for two hours
in the garden, then have supper, and afterward
games in the parlor.</p>

<p>Johnnie felt as if she had taken a dose of
laughing-gas, at the sight of twenty boys and
girls all at once, real boys, real girls! How long
it was since she had seen any! She capered and
jumped in a way which astonished Miss Inches,
and her high spirits so infected the rest that a
general romp set in, and the party grew noisy
to an appalling degree.</p>

<p>"Oh, Johnnie dear, no more 'Tag,'" cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
poor Mamma Marion, catching her adopted
child and wiping her hot face with a handkerchief.
"It is really too rude, such a game as
that. It is only fit for boys."</p>

<p>"Oh, please!&mdash;please!&mdash;<i>please</i>!" entreated
Johnnie. "It is splendid. Papa always let us;
he did indeed, he always did."</p>

<p>"I thought you were my child now, and
anxious for better things than tag," said Miss
Inches gravely. Johnnie had to submit, but
she pouted, shrugged her shoulders, and looked
crossly about her, in a way which Mamma
Marion had never seen before, and which annoyed
her very much.</p>

<p>"Now it is time to go to supper," she announced.
"Form yourselves into a procession,
children. Johnnie shall take this tambourine
and Willy Parker these castanets, and we will
march in to the sound of music."</p>

<p>Johnnie liked to beat the tambourine very
much, so her sulks gave place at once to smiles.
The boys and girls sorted themselves into couples,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Miss Inches took the head of the procession
with an accordion, Willy Parker clashed
the castanets as well as he could, and they all
marched into the house. The table was beautifully
spread with flowers and grapes and pretty
china. Johnnie took the head, Willy the foot,
and Dinah the housemaid helped them all round
to sliced peaches and cream.</p>

<p>Miss Inches meanwhile sat down in the corner
of the room and drew a little table full of books
near her. As soon as they were all served, she
began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, dear children, while you eat, I will
read aloud a little. I should like to think that
each one of you carried away one thought at
least from this entertainment,&mdash;a thought which
would stay by you, and be, as it were, seed-grain
for other thoughts in years to come.
First, I will read 'Abou Ben Adhem,' by Leigh
Hunt, an English poet."</p>

<p>The children listened quietly to Abou Ben
Adhem, but when Miss Inches opened another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
book and began to read sentences from Emerson,
a deep gloom fell upon the party. Willy
Parker kicked his neighbor and made a face.
Lucy Hooper and Grace Sherwood whispered
behind their napkins, and got to laughing till
they both choked. Johnnie's cross feelings
came back; she felt as if the party was being
spoiled, and she wanted to cry. A low buzz of
whispers, broken by titters, went round the table,
and through it all Miss Inches' voice sounded
solemn and distinct, as she slowly read one passage
after another, pausing between each to let
the meaning sink properly into the youthful
mind.</p>

<p>Altogether the supper was a failure, in spite
of peaches and cream and a delicious cake full
of plums and citron. When it was over they
went into the parlor to play. The game <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'o'">of</ins>
"Twenty Questions" was the first one chosen.
Miss Inches played too. The word she suggested
was "iconoclast."</p>

<p>"We don't know what it means," objected
the children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't you, dears? It means a breaker
of idols. However, if you are not familiar with
it we will choose something else. How would
'Michael Angelo' do?"</p>

<p>"But we never heard any thing about him."</p>

<p>Miss Inches was shocked at this, and began
a little art-lecture on the spot, in the midst of
which Willy Parker broke in with, "I've thought
of a word,&mdash;'hash'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Capital! Hash is a splendid
word!" chorussed the others, and poor Miss
Inches, who had only got as far as Michael
Angelo's fourteenth year, found that no one
was listening, and stopped abruptly. Hash
seemed to her a vulgar word for the children to
choose, but there was no help for it, and she
resigned herself.</p>

<p>Johnnie thought hash an excellent word. It
was so funny when Lucy asked whether the
thing chosen was animal, vegetable, or mineral?
and Willy replied, "All three," for he explained
in a whisper, there was always salt in hash, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
salt was a mineral. "Have you all seen it?"
questioned Lucy. "Lots of times," shouted the
children, and there was much laughing. After
"Twenty Questions," they played "Sim says
wiggle-waggle," and after that, "Hunt the
Slipper." Poor, kind, puzzled Miss Inches was
relieved when they went away, for it seemed to
her that their games were all noisy and a fearful
waste of time. She resolved that she would
never give Johnnie any more parties; they upset
the child completely, and demoralized her
mind.</p>

<p>Johnnie <i>was</i> upset. After the party she was
never so studious or so docile as she had been
before. The little taste of play made her dislike
work, and set her to longing after the home-life
where play and work were mixed with each
other as a matter of course. She began to
think that it would be only pleasant to make up
her bed, or dust a room again, and she pined
for the old nursery, for Phil's whistle, for Elsie
and the paper-dolls, and to feel Katy's arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
round her once more. Her letters showed the
growing home-sickness. Dr. Carr felt that the
experiment had lasted long enough. So he discovered
that he had business in Boston, and one
fine September day, as Johnnie was forlornly
poring over her lesson in moral philosophy, the
door opened and in came Papa. Such a shriek
as she gave! Miss Inches happened to be out,
and they had the house to themselves for a while.</p>

<p>"So you are glad to see me?" said Papa,
when Johnnie had dried her eyes after the
violent fit of crying which was his welcome, and
had raised her head from his shoulder. His
own eyes were a little moist, but he spoke
gaily.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, <i>so</i> glad! I was just longing for
you to come. How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"I had business in this part of the world, and
I thought you might be wanting your winter
clothes."</p>

<p>Johnnie's face fell.</p>

<p>"<i>Must</i> I stay all winter?" she said in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
trembling voice. "Aren't you going to take
me home?"</p>

<p>"But I thought you wanted to be 'adopted,'
and to go to Europe, and have all sorts of fine
things happen to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, don't tease me. Mamma Marion
is ever so kind, but I want to come back and be
your little girl again. Please let me. If you
don't, I shall <i>die</i>&mdash;" and Johnnie wrung her
hands.</p>

<p>"We'll see about it," said Dr. Carr. "Don't
die, but kiss me and wash your face. It won't
do for Miss Inches to come home and find you
with those impolite red rims to your eyes."</p>

<p>"Come upstairs, too, and see my room, while
I wash 'em," pleaded Johnnie.</p>

<p>All the time that Johnnie was bathing her
eyes, Papa walked leisurely about looking at
the pictures. His mouth wore a furtive smile.</p>

<p>"This is a sweet thing," he observed, "this
one with the pickled asparagus and the donkey,
or is it a cat?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa! it's a pig!"</p>

<p>Then they both laughed.</p>

<p>I think there was a little bit of relief mixed
with Miss Inches' disappointment at hearing of
Johnnie's decision. The child of theory was a
delightful thing to have in the house, but this
real child, with moods and tempers and a will
of her own, who preferred chromos to Raphael,
and pined after "tag," tried her considerably.
They parted, however, most affectionately.</p>

<p>"Good-by, dear Mamma Marion," whispered
Johnnie. "You've been just as good as good
to me, and I love you so much,&mdash;but you know
I am <i>used</i> to the girls and Papa."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I know. You're to come back
often, Papa says, and I shall call you my girl
always." So, with kisses, they separated, and
Miss Inches went back to her old life, feeling
that it was rather comfortable not to be any
longer responsible for a "young intelligence,"
and that she should never envy mammas with
big families of children again, as once she had
done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"So we've got our Curly Locks back," said
Katy, fondly stroking Johnnie's hair, the night
after the travellers' return. "And you'll never
go away from us any more, will you?"</p>

<p>"Never, never, never!" protested Johnnie,
emphasizing each word by a kiss.</p>

<p>"Not even to be adopted, travel in Europe, or
speak Litchfield Co. French?" put in naughty
Clover.</p>

<p>"No. I've been adopted once, and that's
enough. Now I'm going to be Papa's little girl
always, and when the rest of you get married
I shall stay at home and keep house for him."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Dr. Carr.</p>

</div>


<p>"BUT why
must I go to
bed? It isn't
time, and I'm
not sleepy yet,"
pleaded Dickie,
holding fast by the
side of the door.</p>

<p>"Now, Dickie,
don't be naughty.
It's time because I say that it's time."</p>

<p>"Papa never tells me it's time when it's light
like this," argued Dickie. "<i>He</i> doesn't ever
send me to bed till seven o'clock. I'm not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
going till it's a great deal darker than this. So
there, Mally Spence."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are, Dickie darling," replied
Mally coaxingly. "The reason it's light is because
the days are so long now. It's quite late
really,&mdash;almost seven o'clock,&mdash;that is," she
added hastily, "it's past six (two minutes past!),
and sister wants to put Dickie to bed, because
she's going to take tea with Jane Foster, and
unless Dick is safe and sound she can't go.
Dickie would be sorry to make sister lose her
pleasure, wouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"I wiss you didn't want me to go," urged
Dick, but he was a sweet-tempered little soul,
so he yielded to Mally's gentle pull, and suffered
her to lead him in-doors. Upstairs they went,
past Mally's room, Papa's,&mdash;up another flight of
stairs, and into the attic chamber where Dick
slept alone. It was a tiny chamber. The ceiling
was low, and the walls sloped inward like
the sides of a tent. It would have been too
small to hold a grown person comfortably, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
there was room in plenty for Dickie's bed, one
chair, and the chest of drawers which held his
clothes and toys. One narrow window lighted
it, opening toward the West. On the white
plastered wall beside it, lay a window-shaped
patch of warm pink light. The light was reflected
from the sunset. Dickie had seen this
light come and go very often. He liked to
have it there; it was so pretty, he thought.</p>

<p>Malvina undressed him. She did not talk as
much as usual, for her head was full of the tea-party,
and she was in a hurry to get through
and be off. Dickie, however, was not the least
in a hurry. Slowly he raised one foot, then the
other, to have his shoes untied, slowly turned
himself that Mally might unfasten his apron.
All the time he talked. Mally thought she had
never known him ask so many questions, or
take so much time about every thing.</p>

<p>"What makes the wall pink?" he said. "It
never is 'cept just at bedtime."</p>

<p>"It's the sun."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why doesn't the sun make it that color
always?"</p>

<p>"The sun is setting now. He is not setting
always."</p>

<p>"That's an improper word. You mustn't
say it."</p>

<p>"What's an improper word?"</p>

<p>"Papa <i>said</i>, when I said 'setting on the door-steps,'
that it wasn't proper to say that. He
said I must say <i>sitting</i> on the door steps."</p>

<p>"That isn't the same thing, Goosey Gander,"
cried Mally laughing. "The sun sets and little
boys sit."</p>

<p>"I'm not a goosey gander," responded Dickie.
"And Papa <i>said</i> it wasn't proper."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mally, whipping on his
night-gown: "you're a darling, if you are a
goosey. Now say your prayers nicely."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dick, dreamily. He knelt
down and began his usual prayer. "Please,
God, bless Papa and Mally and Gwandmamma
and&mdash;" "make Dick a good boy" should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
come next, but his thoughts wandered. "Why
don't the sun sit as well as little boys?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dickie, Dickie!" cried the scandalized
Malvina. "You're saying your prayers, you
know. Good children don't stop to ask questions
when they're saying their prayers."</p>

<p>Dickie felt rebuked. He finished the little
prayer quickly. Mally lifted him into bed.
"It's so warm that you won't want this," she
said, folding back the blanket. Then she stooped
to kiss him.</p>

<p>"Tell me a story before you go," pleaded
Dickie, holding her tight.</p>

<p>"Oh, not to-night, darling, because I shall
be late to Jane's if I do." She kissed him
hastily.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's nice at all to go to bed
when the sun hasn't sit, and I'm not sleepy a
bit, and there isn't nothing to play with," remarked
Dick, plaintively.</p>

<p>"You'll fall asleep in a minute or two, Goosey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
then you won't want any thing to play with,"
said Mally, hurrying away.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> a goosey," shouted Dick after her.
Ten minutes later, as she was tying her bonnet
strings, she heard him calling from the top of
the stairs.</p>

<p>"What is it, Dickie?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a goose. Goosies has feathers.
They say 'quack.'"</p>

<p>"You're the kind that hasn't feathers and
doesn't say quack," replied Mally from below.
"No, darling, you're not a goose; you're Mally's
good boy. Now, run back to bed."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," replied Dick, satisfied by this
concession. He climbed into bed again, and lay
watching the pink patch on the wall. Yellow
bars began to appear and to dance in the midst
of the pink.</p>

<p>"Like teeny-weeney little ladders," thought
Dick. There was a ladder outside his door,
at top of which was a scuttle opening on to
the roof. Dickie turned his head to look at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the ladder. The scuttle-door stood open;
from above, the pink light streamed in and lay
on the rungs of the ladder.</p>

<p>"I did go up that ladder once," soliloquized
Dick. "Papa took me. It was velly nice up
there. I wiss Papa would take me again.
Mally, she said it was dangewous. I wonder
why she said it was dangewous? Mally's a very
funny girl, I think. She didn't ought to put
me to bed so early. I can't go to sleep at all.
Perhaps I sha'n't ever go to sleep, not till morning,&mdash;then
she'd feel sorry.</p>

<p>"If I was a bird I could climb little bits of
ladders like that," was his next reflection. "Or
a fly. I'd like to be a fly, and eat sugar, and
say b-u-z-z-z all day long. Only then perhaps
some little boy would get me into the corner
of the window and squeeze me all up tight with
his fum." Dickie cast a rueful look at his own
guilty thumb as he thought this. "I wouldn't
like that! But I'd like very much indeed to
buzz and tickle Mally's nose when she was twying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to sew. She'd slap and slap, and not hit me,
and I'd buzz and tickle. How I'd laugh! But
perhaps flies don't know how to laugh, only just
to buzz.</p>

<div class='center'>
"'Pretty, curious, buzzy fly.'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>That's what my book says."</div>

<p>The pink glow was all gone now, and Dick
shifted his position.</p>

<p>"I <i>wiss</i> I could go to sleep," he thought.
"It isn't nice at all to be up here and not have
any playthings. Mally's gone, else she'd get me
something to amoose myself with. I'd like my
dwum best. It's under the hall table, I guess.
P'waps if I went down I could get it."</p>

<p>As this idea crossed his mind, Dickie popped
quickly out of bed. The floor felt cool and
pleasant to his bare little feet as he crossed to
the door. He had almost reached the head of
the stairs when, looking up, something so pretty
met his eyes that he stopped to admire. It was
a star, shining against the pure sky like a twinkling
silver lamp. It seemed to beckon, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ladder to lead straight up to it. Almost without
stopping to think, Dickie put his foot on the
first rung and climbed nimbly to the top of the
ladder. The star was just as much out of reach
when he got there as it had been before, but
there were other beautiful sights close at hand
which were well worth the trouble of climbing
after.</p>

<p>Miles and miles and miles of sky for one thing.
It rose above Dickie's head like a great blue
dome pierced with pin-pricks of holes, through
which little points of bright light quivered and
danced. Far away against the sky appeared
a church spire, like a long sharp finger pointing
to Heaven. One little star exactly above,
seemed stuck on the end of the spire. Dickie
wondered if it hurt the star to be there. He
stepped out on to the roof and wandered about.
The evening was warm and soft. No dew fell.
The shingles still kept the heat of the sun, and
felt pleasant and comfortable under his feet.
By-and-by a splendid rocker-shaped moon came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from behind the sky's edge where she had been
hiding away, and sailed slowly upward. She
was a great deal bigger than the stars, but they
didn't seem afraid of her in the least. Dickie
reflected that if he were a star he should hurry
to get out of her way; but the stars didn't mind
the moon's being there at all, they kept their
places, and shone calmly on as they had done
before she came.</p>

<p>He was standing, when the moon appeared,
by the low railing which guarded the edge of
the roof. The railing was of a very desirable
height. Dickie could just rest his chin on
top of it, which was nice. Suddenly a loud
"Maau-w!" resounded from above. Dickie
jumped, and gave his poor chin a knock against
the railing. It couldn't be the moon, could it?
Moons didn't make noises like that.</p>

<p>He looked up. There, on the ridge pole of
the next roof, sat a black cat, big and terrible
against the sky. "Ma-a-uw," said the cat again,
louder than before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, pussy, what's the matter?" cried
Dick. His voice quavered a little, but he tried
to speak boldly. Pussy was displeased at the
question. She hissed, put up her back, swelled
her tail to a puff, and fled to a distant part of
the roof, where, from some hidden ambush, Dick
could hear her scolding savagely.</p>

<p>"She's a cwoss cat, I guess," he remarked philosophically.
"Why, this chimney is warm," he
cried, as his arm touched the bricks. "It's
'cause there used to be a fire in there. But
there isn't any smoke coming out. I wonder if
all the chimneys are warm too, like this one."</p>

<p>There was another chimney not far off, and
Dick hastened to try the experiment. To do
this he was obliged to climb a railing, but it was
low and easy to get over. The second chimney
was cold, but a little farther on appeared a third,
and Dick proceeded to climb another railing.</p>

<p>But before he reached this third chimney, a
surprising and interesting sight attracted his
attention. This was a scuttle door just like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
one at home, standing open, with a ladder leading
down into a garret below.</p>

<p>Dick peered over the edge of the scuttle.
There was no little chamber in this attic like his
at home. It was all an open space, crammed
with trunks, furniture, boxes, and barrels. He
caught sight of a rocking-horse standing in a
corner; a rocking-horse with a blue saddle on
his wooden back, and a fierce bristling mane
much in need of brush and comb. Drawn by
irresistible attraction, Dickie put, first one foot,
then the other, over the scuttle's edge, crept
down the ladder, and in another moment stood
by the motionless steed. Thick dust lay on
the saddle, on the rockers, and on the stiffly
stretched-out tail, from which most of the red
paint had been worn away. It was evidently
a long time since any little boy had mounted
there, chirruped to the horse, and ridden gloriously
away, pursuing a fairy fox through imaginary
fields. The eye of the wooden horse was
glazed and dim. Life had lost its interest to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the poor animal, turned out, as it were, to pasture
as best he might in the dull, silent garret.</p>

<p>Dickie patted the red neck, a timid, affectionate
pat, but it startled the horse a little,
for he shook visibly, and swayed to and fro.
There was evidently some "go" left in him,
in spite of his dejected expression of countenance.
The shabby stirrup hung at his side.
Dickie could just reach it with his foot. He
seized the mane, and, pulling hard, clambered
into the saddle. Once there, reins in hand, he
clucked and encouraged the time-worn steed to
his best paces. To and fro, to and fro they
swung, faster, slower, Dickie beating with his
heels, the wooden horse curveting and prancing.
It was famous! The dull thud of the rockers
echoed through the garret, and somebody sitting
in the room below raised his head to listen
to the strange sound.</p>

<p>This somebody was an old man with white
hair and a gray, stern face, who sat beside a
table on which were paper and lighted candles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
A letter lay before him, but he was not reading
it. When the sound of the rocking began, he
started and turned pale. A little boy once
used to rock in that way in the garret overhead,
but it was long ago, and for many years
past the garret had been silent and deserted.
"Harry's horse!" muttered the old man with
a look of fear as he heard the sound. He half
rose from his chair, then he sat down again.
But soon the noise ceased. Dickie had caught
sight of another thing in the garret which interested
him, and had dismounted to examine it.
The old man sank into his chair again with a
look of relief, muttering something about the
wind.</p>

<p>The thing which Dickie had gone to examine
was a little arm-chair cushioned with red. It
was just the size for him, and he seated himself
in it with a look of great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I wiss this chair was mine," he said. "P'waps
Mally'll let me take it home if I ask her."</p>

<p>A noise below attracted his attention. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
peeped over the balusters and saw an elderly
woman, with a candle in her hand, coming up
from the lower story. She went into a room at
the foot of the attic stair, leaving the door open.
"Hester! Hester!" called a voice from below.
The woman came from the room and went down
again. She did not take the candle with her:
Dick could see it shining through the open door.</p>

<p>Like a little moth attracted by a flame, Dick
wandered down the stair in the direction of the
light. The candle was standing on the table in
a bedroom,&mdash;a pretty room, Dickie thought,
though it did not seem as if anybody could
have lived in it lately. He didn't know why
this idea came into his mind, but it did. It was
a girl's bedroom, for a small blue dress hung on
the wall, and on the bureau were brushes, combs,
and hair-pins. Beside the bureau was a wooden
shelf full of books. A bird-cage swung in the
window, but there was no bird in it, and the
seed glass and water cup were empty. The
narrow bed had a white coverlid and a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
white pillow. It looked all ready for somebody,
but it was years since the girl who once owned
the room had slept there. The old housekeeper,
who still loved the girl, came every day to dust
and smooth and air and sweep. She kept all
things in their places just as they used to be in
the former time, but she could not give to the
room the air of life which once it had, and, do
what she would, it looked deserted always&mdash;empty&mdash;and
dreary.</p>

<p>On the chimney-piece were ranged a row of
toys, plaster cats, barking dogs, a Noah's ark,
and an enormous woolly lamb. This last struck
Dick with admiration. He stood on tip-toe with
his hands clasped behind his back to examine it.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," he sighed, "I wiss I had that
lamb." Then he gave a jump, for close to him,
in a small chair, he saw what seemed to be a
little girl, staring straight at him.</p>

<p>It was a big, beautiful doll, in a dress of faded
pink, and a pink hat and feather. Dick had
never seen such a fine lady before; she quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
fascinated him. He leaned gently forward and
touched the waxen hand. It was cold and
clammy; Dick did not like the feel, and retreated.
The unwinking eyes of the doll followed
him as he sidled away, and made him
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>In the opposite room the old man still sat with
his letter before him. The letter was from the
girl who once played with the big doll and slept
in the smooth white bed. She was not a child
now. Years before she had left her father's
house against his will, and in company with a
person he did not like. He had said then that
he should never forgive her, and till now she
had not asked to be forgiven. It was a long
time since he had known any thing about her.
Nobody ever mentioned her name in his hearing,
not even the old housekeeper who loved
her still, and never went to bed without praying
that Miss Ellen might one day come back.
Now Ellen had written to her father. The
letter lay on the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was wrong," she wrote, "but I have been
punished. We have suffered much. My husband
is dead. I will not speak of him, for I
know that his name will anger you; but, father,
I am alone, ill, and very poor. Can you not forgive
me now? Do not think of me as the wild,
reckless girl who disobeyed you and brought
sorrow to your life. I am a weary, sorrowful
woman, longing, above all other things, to be
pardoned before I die,&mdash;to come home again to
the house where all my happy years were spent.
Let me come, father. My little Hester, named
after our dear nurse, mine and Harry's, is a
child whom you would love. She is like me as
I used to be, but far gentler and sweeter than I
ever was. Let me put her in your arms. Let
me feel that I am forgiven for my great fault,
and I will bless you every day that I live.
Dear father, say yes. Your penitent <span class="smcap">Ellen</span>."</p>

<p>Two angels stood behind the old man as he
read this letter. He did not see them, but he
heard their voices as first one and then the
other bent and whispered in his ear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen," murmured the white angel with
radiant moonlit wings. "Listen. You loved
her once so dearly. You love her still. I
know you do."</p>

<p>"No," breathed the darker angel. "You
swore that you would not forgive her. Keep
your word. You always said that she would
come back as soon as she was poor or unhappy,
or that scamp treated her badly. It makes no
difference in the facts. Let her suffer; it serves
her right."</p>

<p>"Remember what a dear child she used to
be," said the fair angel, "so bright, so loving.
How she used to dance about the house and
sing; the sun seemed to shine always when she
came into the room. She loved you truly then.
Her little warm arms were always about your
neck. She loves you still."</p>

<p>"What is love worth," came the other voice,
"when it deceives and hurts and betrays? All
these long years you have suffered. It is her
turn now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Remember that it was partly your fault,"
whispered the spirit of good. "You were harsh
and stern. You did not appeal to her love, but
to her obedience. She had a high spirit; you
forgot that. And she was only sixteen."</p>

<p>"Quite old enough to know better," urged
the spirit of evil. "Remember the hard life you
have led ever since. The neighbors speak of
you as a stern, cruel man; the little children
run away when you appear. Whose fault is
that? Hers. She ought to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Think of the innocent child who never did
you wrong, and who suffers too. Think of the
dear Lord who forgives your sins. Pray to him.
He will help you to forgive her,"&mdash;urged the
good angel, but in fainter tones, for the black
angel spoke louder, and thrust between with his
fierce voice.</p>

<p>"The thing is settled. Why talk of prayer
or pardon? Let her go her way."</p>

<p>As this last whisper reached his ear the old
man raised his bent head. A hard, vindictive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
look was in his eyes. He seized the letter and
tore it in two. "Alas! alas!" sighed the sweet
angel, while the evil one rejoiced and waved his
dark wings in triumph.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Dickie, attracted
by the rustle of paper, appeared at the door.
His eyes were beginning to droop a little. He
rubbed them hard as he crossed the entry. The
pit-pat of his bare feet made no sound on the
carpeted floor, so that the old man had no warning
of his presence till, turning, he saw the
little night-gowned figure standing motionless
in the door-way.</p>

<p>He sprang from his chair and stretched out
his hands. He tried to speak, but no voice
came at first; then in a hoarse whisper he said,&mdash;"Harry&mdash;is
it you? Ellen&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dickie, terrified, fled back into the hall as if
shod with wings. In one moment he was in
the attic, up the ladder, on the roof. The old
man ran blindly after him.</p>

<p>"Come back, Ellen&mdash;come back!" he cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
"I will forgive you,&mdash;come back to your poor
old father, dear child." His foot slipped as he
spoke. It was at the stair-head. He fell forward
heavily, and lump, bump, bump, down
stairs he tumbled, and landed heavily in the
hall below.</p>

<p>Hester and the housemaid ran hastily from
the kitchen at the sound of the fall. When
they saw the old man lying in a heap at the
foot of the stair, they were terribly frightened.
Blood was on his face. He was quite unconscious.</p>

<p>"He is dead. Mr. Kirton is dead!" cried the
housemaid, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;his heart beats," said Hester. "Run
for Doctor Poster, Hannah, and ask Richard
Wallis to come at once and help me lift the
poor old gentleman."</p>

<p>Hannah flew to do this errand. A moment
after, Mr. Kirton opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is Ellen?" he said. Then he shut
them again. Hester glanced at the torn letter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
which through all his fall the old man had held
tightly clasped in his hand, and gave a loud cry.</p>

<p>"Miss Ellen, come back!" she exclaimed.
"My own Miss Ellen. God has heard my
prayers."</p>

<p>When Mr. Kirton's senses returned, late in
the night, he found himself in his own bed.
His head felt strangely; one arm was tied up in
a queer stiff bandage, so that he could not move
it. A cloth wet with water lay on his forehead.
When he stirred and groaned, a hand lifted the
cloth, dipped it in ice-water, and put it back
again fresh and cool. He looked up. Some
one was bending over him, some one with a face
which he knew and did not know. It puzzled
him strangely. At last, a look of recognition
came into his eyes. "Ellen?" he said, in a
tone of question.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear father, it is I."</p>

<p>"Why did you come dressed as a little child
to frighten me? You are a woman," he said
wonderingly; "your hair is gray!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not come as a little child, father. I
am an old woman now. I have come to be your
nurse."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," muttered the old man,
but he asked no more, and presently dropped
asleep. Ellen watched him for a long time,
then she went across the hall to her old room,
where Hester stood looking at a little girl, who
lay on the bed sleeping soundly, with the pink
doll hugged tight in her arms.</p>

<p>"She is just like yourself, Miss Ellen," said
Hester, with joyful tears in her eyes,&mdash;"just
like your old self, with a thought more brown
in the hair. Ah! good times have begun again
for my poor old master; the light has come
back to the house."</p>

<p>But neither Hester nor Ellen saw the white-robed
angel, who bent over the old man's bed
with a face of immortal joy, and sang low songs
of peace to make sleep deep and healing. The
dark spirit has fled away.</p>

<p>Meantime Dickie, unconscious messenger of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Fate, scrambling easily over the roofs, had
gained his own room, and was comfortably
tucked up in his little bed. His dreams were
of dolls, rocking-horses, black cats. So soundly
did he sleep, that, when morning came, Mally
had to shake him and call loudly in his ear
before she could wake him up.</p>

<p>"Why, Dick!" she cried, "look at your
night-gown. It's all over dust, and there are
one&mdash;two&mdash;three tears in the cotton. What
<i>have</i> you been doing?"</p>

<p>But Dickie could not tell.</p>

<p>"I dweamed that I walked about on the woof,"
he said. "But I guess I didn't weally, did I?"</p>

<h2>LITTLE BO PEEP.</h2>


<p>THE sun was setting at the end of an August
day. Everybody was glad to see the last of
him, for the whole world felt scorched and hot,&mdash;the
ground, the houses,&mdash;even the ponds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
looked warm as they stretched in the steaming
distance. On the edge of the horizon the sun
winked with a red eye, as much as to say,
"Don't flatter yourselves, I shall be back again
soon;" then he slowly sank out of sight. It
was comforting to have him go, if only for a
little while. "Perhaps," thought the people,
"a thunder-storm or something may come
along before morning, and cool him off."</p>

<p>Little Mell Davis was as glad as anybody
when the sun disappeared. It had been a hard
day. Her step-mother had spent it in making
soap. Soap-making is ill-smelling, uncomfortable
work at all times, and especially in August.
Mrs. Davis had been cross and fractious, had
scolded a great deal, and found many little jobs
for Mell to do in addition to her usual tasks of
dish-washing, table-setting, and looking after
the children. Mell was tired of the heat; tired
of the smell of soap, of being lectured; and when
supper was over was very glad to sit at peace
on the door-steps and read her favorite book, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
tattered copy of the Fairy Tales. Soon she
forgot the trials of the day. "Once upon a
time there lived a beautiful Princess," she read,
but just then came a sharp call. "Mell, Mell,
you tiresome girl, see what Tommy is about;"
and Mrs. Davis, dashing past, snatched Tommy
away from the pump-handle, which he was plying
vigorously for the benefit of his small sisters,
who stood in a row under the spout, all
dripping wet. Tommy was wetter still, having
impartially pumped on himself first of all.
Frocks, aprons, jacket, all were soaked, shoes
and stockings were drenched, the long pig tails
of the girls streamed large drops, as if they had
been little rusty-colored water-pipes.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" cried Mrs. Davis, exhibiting
the half-drowned brood. "You might as
well be deaf and blind, Mell, for any care you
take of 'em. Give you a silly book to read,
and the children might perish before your eyes
for all you'd notice. Look at Isaphine, and
Gabella Sarah. Little lambs,&mdash;as likely as not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
they've taken their deaths. It shan't happen
again, though. Give me that book&mdash;" And,
snatching Mell's treasure from her hands, Mrs.
Davis flung it into the fire. It flamed, shrivelled:
the White Cat, Cinderella, Beauty
and the Beast,&mdash;all, all were turned in one
moment into a heap of unreadable ashes! Mell
gave one clutch, one scream; then she stood
quite still, with a hard, vindictive look on her
face, which so provoked her step-mother that
she gave her a slap as she hurried the children
upstairs. Mrs. Davis did not often slap Mell.
"I punish my own children," she would say,
"not other people's." "Other people's children"
meant poor Mell.</p>

<p>It was not a very happy home, this of the
Davis's. Mell's father was captain of a whaler,
and almost always at sea. It was three years
now since he sailed on his last voyage. No
word had come from him for a great many
months, and his wife was growing anxious.
This did not sweeten her temper, for in case he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
never returned, Mell's would be another back to
clothe, another mouth to fill, when food, perhaps,
would not be easily come by. Mell was not
anxious about her father. She was used to
having him absent. In fact, she seldom thought
of him one way or another. If Mrs. Davis had
been kinder, and had given her more time to
read the Fairy Tales, she would have been quite
a happy little girl, for she lived in dreams, and
it did not take much to content her. Half her
time was spent in a sort of inward play which
never came out in words. Sometimes in these
plays she was a Princess with a gold crown, and
a delightful Prince making love to her all day
long. Sometimes she kept a candy-shop, and
lived entirely on sugar-almonds and sassafras-stick.
These plays were so real to her mind
that it seemed as if they <i>must</i> some day come
true. Her step-mother and the children did not
often figure in them, though once in a while she
made believe that they were all changed into
agreeable people, and shared her good luck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
There was one thing in the house, however,
which invariably took part in her visions. This
was a large wooden chest with brass handles
which stood upstairs in Mrs. Davis's room, and
was always kept locked.</p>

<p>Mell had never seen the inside of this chest
but once. Then she caught glimpses of a red
shawl, of some coral beads in a box, and of various
interesting looking bundles tied up in paper.
"How beautiful!" she had cried out eagerly,
whereupon Mrs. Davis had closed the lid with a
snap, and locked it, looking quite vexed. "What
is it? Are all those lovely things yours?"
asked Mell, and she had been bidden to hold
her tongue, and see if the kitchen fire didn't
need another stick of wood. It was two years
since this happened. Mell had never seen the
lid raised since, but every day she had played
about the big chest and its contents.</p>

<p>Sometimes she played that the chest belonged
to the beautiful Princess, and was full of her
clothes and jewels. Sometimes a fairy lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
there, who popped out, wand in hand, and made
things over to Mell's liking. Again, Mell played
that she locked her step-mother up into the
chest, and refused to release her till she promised
never, never again, so long as she lived, to
scold about any thing. Mrs. Davis would have
been very vexed had she known about these
plays. It made her angry if Mell so much as
glanced at the chest. "There you are again,
peeping, peeping," she would cry, and drive
Mell before her downstairs.</p>

<p>So this evening, after the burning of the
book, Mell's sore and angry fancies flew as usual
to the chest. "It's so big," she thought, "that
all the children could get into it. I'll play that
a wicked enchanter came and flew away with
mother, and never let her come back. Then I
should have to take care of the children; and
I'd get somebody to nail some boards, so as to
make five dear little cubby-houses inside the
chest. I'd put Tommy in one, Isaphine in
another, Arabella Jane in another, Belinda in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
another, and Gabella Sarah in another. Then
I'd shut the lid down and fasten it, and wouldn't
I have a good time! When dinner was ready
I'd fetch a plate and spoon, feed 'em all round,
and shut 'em up again. It would be just the
same when I washed their faces; I'd just take a
wet cloth and do 'em all with a couple of scrubs.
They couldn't get into mischief I suppose in
there. Yet I don't know. Tommy is so bad
that he would if he could. Let me see,&mdash;what
could he do? If he had a gimlet he'd bore
holes in the boards, and stick pins through to
make the others cry. I must be sure to see if
he has any gimlets in his pocket before I put
him in. Oh, dear, I hope I shan't forget!"</p>

<p>Mell was so absorbed in these visions that she
did not hear the gate open, and when a hand
was suddenly laid on her shoulder she gave a
little cry and a great jump. A tall man had
come in, and was standing close to her.</p>

<p>"Does Mrs. Captain Davis live here?" asked
the tall man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Mell, staring at him with her big
eyes.</p>

<p>"Is she to home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mell again. "She's in there,"
pointing to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The tall man stepped over Mell, and went in.
Mell heard the sound of voices, and grew curious.
She peeped in at the door. Her step-mother
was folding a letter. She looked vexed
about something.</p>

<p>"What time shall you start?" she said.</p>

<p>"Half-past five," replied the man. "I've my
hands to pay at ten, and the weather's so hot
it's best to get off early."</p>

<p>"I suppose I must go," went on Mrs. Davis,
"though I'd rather be whipped than do it. You
can stop if you've a mind to: I'll be ready."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the man. "You haven't
got a drink of cider in the house, have you?
This dust has made me as dry as a chip."</p>

<p>"Mell, run down cellar and fetch some," said
Mrs. Davis. "It was good cider once, but I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
afraid it's pretty hard now." She bustled about;
brought doughnuts and a pitcher of water. The
man drank a glass of the sour cider and went
away. Mrs. Davis sat awhile thinking. Then
she turned sharply on Mell.</p>

<p>"I've got to go from home to-morrow on
business," she said. "Perhaps I shall be back by
tea-time, and perhaps I sha'n't. If there was
anybody I could get to leave the house with I
would, but there isn't anybody. Now, listen to
me, Mell Davis. Don't you open a book to-morrow,
not once; but keep your eyes on the children,
and see that they don't get into mischief.
If they do, I shall know who to thank for it.
I'll make a batch of biscuit to-night before I go
to bed; there's a pie in the cupboard, and some
cold pork, and you can boil potatoes for the
children's breakfast and for dinner. Are you
listening?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," replied Mell.</p>

<p>"See that the children have their faces and
hands washed," went on her step-mother. "Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
dear, if you were a different kind of girl how
much easier would it be! I wish your father
would come home and look after his own affairs,
instead of my having to leave things at sixes and
sevens and go running round the country hunting
up his sick relations for him."</p>

<p>"Is it grandmother who is sick?" asked Mell
timidly. She had never seen her grandmother,
but she had played about her very often.</p>

<p>"No," snapped Mrs. Davis. "It's your
Uncle Peter. Don't ask questions; it's none
of your business who's sick. Mind you strain
the milk the first thing to-morrow, and wring
out the dishcloth when you're through with it.
Oh, dear, to think that I should have to go!"</p>

<p>Mell crept to bed. She was so very tired
that it seemed just one moment before Mrs.
Davis was shaking her arm, and calling her to
get up at once, for it was five o'clock. Slowly
she unclosed her sleepy eyes. Sure enough,
the night was gone. A fiery red bar in the
East showed that the sun too was getting out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of bed, and making ready for a hot day's work.
Mell rubbed her eyes. She wished that it was
all a dream, from which she had waked only to
fall asleep again. But it was no use playing at
dreams with Mrs. Davis standing by.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis was by no means in a humor for
play. People rarely are at five in the morning.
She rushed about the house like a whirlwind,
giving Mell directions, and scolding her in advance
for all the wrong things she was going to
do, till the poor child was completely stunned
and confused. By and by the tall man appeared
with his wagon. Mrs. Davis got in and drove
away, ordering and lecturing till the last moment.
"What's the use of telling, for you're
sure to get it all wrong," were her last words,
and Mell thought so too.</p>

<p>She walked back to the house feeling stupid
and unhappy. But the quiet did her good, and
as gradually she realized that her step-mother
was actually gone,&mdash;gone for the whole day,&mdash;her
spirits revived, and she began to smile and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sing softly to herself. Very few little girls of
twelve would, I think, have managed better
than Mell did for the first half of that morning.</p>

<p>First she got breakfast, only bread and milk
and baked potatoes, but there is a wrong as well
as a right way with even such simple things, and
Mell really did all very cleverly. She swept
the kitchen, strained the milk, wound the clock.
Then, as a sound of twittering voices began
above, she ran up to the children, washed and
dressed, braided the red pigtails, and got them
downstairs successfully, with only one fight between
Tommy and Isaphine, and a roaring fit
from Arabella Jane, who was a tearful child.
After breakfast, while the little ones played on
the door-steps, she tidied the room, mended the
fire, washed plates and cups, and put them away
in the cupboard, wrung out the dishcloth according
to orders, and hung it on its nail. When
this was finished she looked about with pride.
The children were unusually peaceful; altogether,
the day promised well. "Mother'll not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
say that I'm a good-for-nothing girl <i>this</i> time,"
thought Mell, and tried to recollect what should
be done next.</p>

<p>The kerosene can caught her eye.</p>

<p>"I'll clean the lamp," she said.</p>

<p>She had never cleaned the lamp before, but
had seen her step-mother do it very often. First,
she took the lamp-scissors from the table drawer
and cut the wick, rather jaggedly, but Mell did
not know that. Then she tipped the can to fill
the lamp. Here the misfortunes of the day
began; for the can slipped, and some of the oil
was spilled on the floor. This terrified Mell, for
that kitchen-floor was the idol of Mrs. Davis's
heart. It was scrubbed every day, and kept as
white as snow. Mell knew that her step-mother's
eyes would be keen as Blue Beard's to detect a
spot; and, with all the energy of despair, she
rubbed and scoured with soap and hot water.
It was all in vain. The spot would not come
out.</p>

<p>"I'll put a chair there," thought Mell. "Then
perhaps she won't see it just at first."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want that scissors," cried Tommy from
the door.</p>

<p>"You can't have it," replied Mell, hurrying
them into the drawer. "It's a bad scissors,
Tommy, all oily and dirty. Nice little boys
don't want to play with such dirty scissors as
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, they do," whined Tommy, quite unconvinced.</p>

<p>"Now, children," continued Mell, "I'm going
upstairs to make the beds. You must play just
here, and not go outside the gate till I come
down again. I shall be at the window, and see
you all the time. Will you promise to be good
and do as I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Es," lisped Gabella Sarah.</p>

<p>"Es," said Isaphine.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," clamored the others, headed by
Tommy, who was a child of promise if ever
there was one. All the time his eyes were
fixed on the table drawer!</p>

<p>Mell went upstairs. First into the children's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
room, then into her own. She put her head
out of the window once or twice. The children
were playing quietly; Tommy had gone in for
something, they said. Last of all, Mell went
to her step-mother's room. She had just begun
to smooth the bed, when an astonishing sight
caught her eyes. <i>The key was in the lock of
the big chest!</i></p>

<p>Yes, actually, the fairy treasury, home of so
many fancies, was left unlocked! How Mrs.
Davis came to do so careless a thing will never
be known, but that she had done so was a fact.</p>

<p>Mell thought at first that her eyes deceived
her. She stole across the room and touched the
key timidly with her forefinger to make sure.
Then she lifted the lid a little way and let it fall
again, looking over her shoulder as if fearing to
hear a sharp voice from the stairs. Next, grown
bolder, she opened the lid wide. There lay the
red shawl, just as she remembered it, the coral
beads in their lidless box, the blue paper parcels,
and, forgetting all consequences in a rapture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
curiosity, Mell sat down on the floor, lifted out
the red shawl, tied the coral beads round her
neck, and plunged boldly into the contents of
the big chest.</p>

<p>Such a delightful chest as it proved to be!
Mell thought it a great deal better than any
fairy tale, as one by one she lifted out and
handled the things which it contained. First
and most beautiful was a parasol. It was covered
with faded pink silk trimmed with fringe,
and had a long white handle ending in a curved
hook. Mell had never seen a parasol so fine.
She opened it, shut it, opened it again; she
held it over her head and went to the glass to
see the effect. It was gorgeous, it was like the
parasols of Fairy-land, Mell thought. She laid it
on the floor close beside her, that she might see
it all the while she explored the chest.</p>

<p>Below the parasol was a big paper box. Mell
lifted the lid. A muff and tippet lay inside,
made of yellow and brown fur like the back
of a tortoise-shell cat. These were beautiful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
too. Then came rolls of calico and woollen
pieces, some of which were very pretty, and
would make nice doll's dresses, Mell thought.</p>

<p>A newspaper parcel next claimed her attention.
It held an old-fashioned work-bag made
of melon seeds strung on wire, and lined with
green. Mell admired this exceedingly, and
pinned it to her waist. Then she found a fan
of white feathers with pink sticks. This was
most charming of all. Mell fanned herself a
long time. She could not bear to put it away.
Princesses, she thought, must use fans like that.
On the paper which wrapped the fan was something
written in pencil. Mell spelled it out.
"For my little Melicent" was what the writing
said.</p>

<p>Was the fan really hers? Perhaps the parasol
was hers too, the coral beads, the muff and
tippet! All sorts of delightful possibilities
whirled through her brain, as she tossed and
tumbled the parcels in the chest out on to the
floor. More bundles of pieces, some knitting-needles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
an old-fashioned pair of bellows (Mell
did not know what these were), a book or two,
a package of snuff, which flew up into her face
and made her sneeze. Then an overcoat and
some men's clothes folded smoothly. Mell did
not care for the overcoat, but there were two
dresses pinned in towels which delighted her.
One was purple muslin, the other faded blue
silk; and again she found her own name pinned
on the towel,&mdash;"For my little Mell." A faint
pleasant odor came from the folds of the blue
silk dress. Mell searched the pocket, and found
there a Tonquin bean, screwed up in a bit of
paper. It was the Tonquin bean which had
made the dress smell so pleasantly. Mell
pressed the folds close to her nose. She was
fond of perfumes, and this seemed to her the
most delicious thing she ever smelt.</p>

<p>Suddenly the clock downstairs struck something
very long, and Mell, waking up as it were,
recollected that it was a good while since she
had heard any sounds from the children in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
yard. She jumped up and ran to the window.
No children were there.</p>

<p>"Children, children, where are you?" she
called; but nobody answered.</p>

<p>"Tiresome little things," thought Mell.
"They've gone round to the pump again. I
must hurry, or they will be all sopping wet."
She seized the parasol, which she could not bear
to part with, and, leaving the other things on
the floor, ran downstairs. The red shawl, which
had been lying in her lap, trailed after her as
far as the kitchen, and then fell, but Mell did
not notice it.</p>

<p>"What!" she cried, looking at the clock,
"noon already! Why, where has the morning
gone to?"</p>

<p>Where had the children gone to? was another
question. Back yard, side yard, front
yard, cellar, shed, Mell searched. There were
no small figures ranged about the pump, no
voices replied to her calls. Mell ran to the gate.
She strained her eyes down the road, this way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that way; not a sign of the little flock was visible
in any direction.</p>

<p>Now Mell <i>was</i> frightened. "What <i>will</i>
mother say?" she thought, and began to run
distractedly along the road, crying and sobbing
as she went, and telling herself that it wasn't
her fault, that she only went upstairs to make
the beds,&mdash;but here her conscience gave a great
prick. It was but ten o'clock when she went
upstairs to make the beds!</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she sobbed. "If only Tommy
isn't drowned!" Drowning came into her head
first, because her step-mother was always in an
agony about the pond. The pond was a mile
off at least, but Mrs. Davis never let the children
even look that way if she could help it.</p>

<p>Toward the pond poor Mell bent her way;
for she thought as Tommy had been strictly forbidden
to go there, it was probably the very
road he had taken. The sun beat on her head
and she put up the parasol, which through all
her trouble she had grasped firmly in her hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Even under these dreadful circumstances, with
the children lost, and the certainty of her step-mother's
wrath before her, there was joy in
carrying a parasol like that.</p>

<p>By and by she met a farmer with a yoke
of oxen.</p>

<p>"Oh, please," said Mell, "have you seen five
children going this way,&mdash;four girls and one
little boy?"</p>

<p>The farmer hummed and hawed. "I did see
some children," he said at last. "It was a
good piece back, nearly an hour ago, I reckon.
They was making for the pond?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Mell. She thanked the
farmer, and ran on faster than ever.</p>

<p>"Have you passed any children on this
road?" she demanded of a boy with a wheelbarrow,
who was the next person she met.</p>

<p>"Boys or girls?"</p>

<p>"One boy and four girls."</p>

<p>"Do they belong to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they're my brothers and sisters," said
Mell. "Where did you see them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't seen 'em," replied the boy. He
grinned as he spoke, seized his barrow, and
wheeled rapidly away.</p>

<p>Mell's tears broke forth afresh. What a
horrid boy!</p>

<p>The pond was very near now. It was a
large pond. There were hills on one side of
it; on the other the shore was low, and covered
with thick bushes. In and out among these
bushes went Mell, hunting for her lost flock.
It was green and shady. Flowers grew here
and there; bright berries hung on the boughs
above her head; birds sang; a saucy squirrel
ran to the end of a branch, and chippered to
her as she passed. But Mell saw none of these
things. She was too anxious and unhappy to
enjoy what on any other day would have been
a great pleasure; and she passed the flowers,
the berries, and the chattering squirrel unheeded
by.</p>

<p>No signs of the children appeared, till at last,
in a marshy place, a small shoe was seen sticking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in the mud. Belinda's shoe! Mell knew
it in a minute.</p>

<p>She picked up the shoe, wiped the mud from
it with a tuft of dried grass, and, carrying it in
her hand, went forward. She was on the track
now, and here and there prints of small feet in
the earth guided her. She called "Tommy!
Isaphine! Belinda!" but no answer came.
They were either hidden cleverly, or else they
had wandered a longer distance than seemed
possible in so short a time.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mell gave a shriek and a jump.
There on the path before her lay a snake, or
what looked like one. It did not move. Mell
grew bold and went nearer. Alas! alas! it
was not a snake. It was a pigtail of braided
hair,&mdash;Isaphine's hair: the red color was unmistakable.
She seized it. A smell of kerosene
met her nose. Oh that Tommy!</p>

<p>With the pigtail coiled inside of the lost
shoe, Mell ran on. She was passing a thicket
of sassafras bushes, when a sound of crying met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her ears. Instantly she stopped, and, parting
the bushes with her hands, peered in. There
they were, sitting in a little circle close together,&mdash;Arabella
and Gabella Sarah fast asleep,
with their heads in Belinda's lap; Isaphine
crying; Tommy sitting a little apart, an evil
smile on his face, in his hand a pair of scissors!</p>

<p>"You naughty, naughty, naughty boy,"
screamed Mell, flinging herself upon him.</p>

<p>With a howl of terror, Tommy started up and
prepared to flee. Mell caught and held him
tight. Something flew from his lap and fell to
the ground. Alas! alas! three more pigtails.
Mell looked at the children. Each little head
was cropped close. What <i>would</i> mother say?</p>

<p>"He cut off my hair," sobbed Isaphine.</p>

<p>"So did he cut mine," whined Belinda.
"He took those nassy scissors you told him not
to take, and he cut off all our hairs. Boo-hoo!
boo-hoo! Tommy's a notty boy, he is."</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell Ma when she comes home,
see if I don't," added Isaphine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't a bad boy," cried Tommy. "Stop
a-shaking of me, Mell Davis. We was playing
they was sheep. I was a-shearing of em."</p>

<p>"O Tommy, Tommy!" cried poor Mell, hot,
angry, and dismayed, "how could you do such
a thing?"</p>

<p>"They was sheep," retorted Tommy sulkily.</p>

<p>"Boo-hoo! boo-hoo!" blubbered Belinda.
"I don't like my hair to be cut off. It makes
my head feel all cold."</p>

<p>"He didn't play nice a bit," sobbed Isaphine.
"He's always notty to us."</p>

<p>"I'll cut off your head," declared Tommy,
threatening with the scissors.</p>

<p>Mell seized the scissors, and captured them,
Tommy kicking and struggling meantime.
Then she waked up the babies, tied on Belinda's
shoe, collected the unhappy pigtails, and
said they must all go home. Home! The
very idea made her sick with fright.</p>

<p>I don't suppose such a deplorable little procession
was ever seen before. Isaphine and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Belinda went first; then the little ones, very
cross after their nap; and, lastly, Mell, holding
Tommy's arm, and driving the poor little shorn
sheep before her with the handle of the parasol,
which she used as a shepherdess uses her crook.
They were all tired and hungry. The babies
cried. The sun was very hot. The road
seemed miles long. Every now and then Mell
had to let them sit down to rest. It was nearly
four o'clock when they reached home; and,
long before that, Mell was so weary and discouraged
that it seemed as if she should like to
lie down and die.</p>

<p>They got home at last. Mell's hand was on the
garden gate, when suddenly a sight so terrible
met her eyes that she stood rooted to the spot,
unable to move an inch further. There in the
doorway was Mrs. Davis. Her face was white
with anger as she looked at the children. Mell
felt the coral beads burn about her throat. She
dropped the parasol as if her arm was broken,
the guilty tails hung from her hand, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
wished with all her heart that the earth could
open and swallow her up.</p>

<p>It was a full moment before anybody spoke.
Then "What does this mean?" asked Mrs.
Davis, in an awful voice.</p>

<p>Mell could not answer. But the children
broke out in full chorus of lament.</p>

<p>"Tommy was so bad to us." "He lost us in
the woods." "He stole the scissors, and they
were dirty scissors." "Mell went away and
left us all alone."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Mrs. Davis, her wrath rising
with each word, "I know very well what you
were up to, miss. All my things upset. As
soon as I found out that I had forgotten my
key, I knew very well&mdash;" her voice died away
into the silence of horror. She had just caught
sight of Belinda's cropped head.</p>

<p>"Tommy did it. He cut off all our hairs,"
blubbered Belinda.</p>

<p>Mell shut her eyes tight. She was too
frightened to move. She felt herself clutched,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
dragged in-doors, upstairs, and her ears boxed,
all in a moment. Mrs. Davis pushed her violently
forward, a door banged, a key turned.</p>

<p>"There you stay for a week, and on bread and
water," cried a voice through the keyhole;
and Mell, opening her eyes, found herself in the
dark and alone. She knew very well where
she was,&mdash;in the closet under the attic stairs;
a place she dreaded, because she had once seen
a mouse there, and Mell was particularly afraid
of mice.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't shut me up here! Please don't;
please let me out, please," she shrieked. But
Mrs. Davis had gone downstairs, and nobody
replied.</p>

<p>"They'll come and eat me up as soon as it
grows dark," thought Mell; and this idea so terrified
her that she began to beat on the door
with her hands, and scream at the top of her
voice. No one came. And after a while she
grew so weary that she could scream no longer;
so she curled herself up on the floor of the
closet and went to sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>When she woke the closet was darker than
ever. Mell felt weak and ill for want of food.
Her head ached; her bones ached from lying
on the hard floor; she was feverish and very
miserable.</p>

<p>"It's dark; she's going to leave me here all
night," sobbed Mell. "Oh! won't somebody
come and let me out?" Now <i>would</i> have been
a chance to play that she was a princess shut
up in a dark dungeon! But Mell didn't feel
like playing. She was a real little girl shut up
in a closet, and it wasn't nice at all. There
was no "make believe" left in her just then.</p>

<p>Suddenly a fine scratching sound began in
the wall close to her head. "The mouse, the
mouse," thought Mell, and she gave a shriek so
loud that it would have scared away a whole
army of mice. The shriek sounded all over the
house. It woke the children in their beds, and
rang in the ears of Mrs. Davis, who was sitting
down to supper in the kitchen with somebody
just arrived,&mdash;a big, brown, rough-bearded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
somebody, who smelt of salt-water; Mell's father,
in short, returned from sea.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Captain Davis, putting
down his cup.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis was frightened. In the excitement
of her husband's sudden return she had
quite forgotten poor Mell in her closet.</p>

<p>"Some of the children," she answered, trying
to speak carelessly. "I'll run up."</p>

<p>Another terrible shriek. Captain Davis seized
a candle, and hurried upstairs after his wife.</p>

<p>He was just in time to see her unlock the
closet door, and poor Mell tumble out, tear-stained,
white, frightened almost out of her
wits. She clutched her step-mother's dress with
both hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't make me go in there again!" she
pleaded. "I will be good. I'll never meddle
with the things in the chest any more. There
are mice in there, hundreds of 'em; they'll
run all over me; they'll eat me up. Oh, <i>don't</i>
make me go in there again!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it's my little Mell!" cried the amazed
Captain. "Shiver my timbers! what does this
mean?" He lifted Mell into his arms and
looked sternly at his wife.</p>

<p>"She's been a <i>very</i> naughty girl," said Mrs.
Davis, trying to speak boldly. "So naughty
that I had to shut her up. Stop crying so, Mell.
I forgive you now. I hope you'll never be so
bad again."</p>

<p>"Oh, may I come out?" sobbed Mell, clinging
to her father's neck. "You said I must stay a
week, but I couldn't do that, the mice would
kill me. Mice are so awful!" She shuddered
with horror as she spoke.</p>

<p>"This ain't a pleasant welcome for a man just
in from sea," remarked Captain Davis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis explained and tried to smooth the
matter over, but the Captain continued very
sober all that evening. Mell thought it was
because he was angry with her, but her step-mother
knew very well that she also was in
disgrace. The truth was that the Captain was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
thinking what to do. He was not a man of
many words, but he felt that affairs at home
must go very wrong when he was away, and
that such a state of things was bad for his wife,
and very bad for Mell.</p>

<p>So in a day or two he went off to Cape Cod,
"to see his old mother," as he said, in reality to
consult her as to what should be done. When
he came back, he asked Mell how she would like
to go and live with Grandmother and be her
little girl.</p>

<p>"Will she shut me up in closets?" asked
Mell apprehensively.</p>

<p>"No, she'll be very kind to you if you are a
good girl. Grandma's an old lady now. She
wants a handy child about the house to help,
and sort of pet and make much of."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;guess&mdash;I'll&mdash;like&mdash;it," said Mell
slowly. "It's a good way from here, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;a good way."</p>

<p>Mell nodded her head in a satisfied manner.
"<i>She'll</i> not often come there," she thought.
"She" meant Mrs. Davis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Davis was unusually pleasant for the few
remaining days which Mell spent at home. I do
not think she had ever meant to treat Mell unkindly,
but she had a hot temper, and the care
of five unruly children is a good deal for one
woman to undertake, without counting in a
little step-daughter with a head stuffed with
fairy stories. She washed and ironed, mended
and packed for Mell as kindly as possible, and
did not say one cross word, not even when her
husband brought the coral necklace from the
big chest and gave it to Mell for her very own.
"The child had a right to her mother's necklace,"
he said. All was peaceful and serene,
and when Mell said good-by she surprised herself
by feeling quite sorry to go, and kissed
Gabella Sarah's small face with tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Grandmother was just such a dear old woman
as one reads about in books. Her cheeks were
all criss-crossed with little wrinkles, which made
her look as if she were always smiling. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
forehead was smooth, her eyes kind and blue.
She was small, thin, and wiry. Her laugh was
as fresh as a young woman's. Mell loved her
at once, and was sure that she should be happy
to live with her and be her little girl.</p>

<p>"Why, Bethuel, you've brought me a real
good helper," said Grandmother, as Mell ran to
and fro, setting the tea-table, cutting bread, and
learning where things were kept. "I shall sit
like a lady and do nothing but rock in my
cheer now that I've got Mell." Mell heard
the kind words, and sprang about more busily
than ever. It was a new thing to be praised.</p>

<p>Before Captain Davis went next day he
walked over to Barnstable, and came back with
a parcel in his hand. The parcel was for Mell.
It contained the Fairy Tales,&mdash;all new and complete,
bound in beautiful red covers.</p>

<p>"You shall read them aloud to me in the
evenings," said Grandmother.</p>

<p>That night, if anybody had peeped through
the window of Grandmother's little house he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
would have seen a pleasant sight. The kitchen
was all in order; the lamp burned clear; Grandmother
sat in her rocking-chair with a smile on
her kind old face, while Mell, at her feet on a
little stool, opened the Fairy Tales, and prepared
to read. "Once upon a time there lived
a beautiful Princess," she began;&mdash;then a sudden
sense of the delightfulness of all this overcame
her. She dropped the book into her lap,
clasped her hands tight, and said, half to herself,
half to Grandmother, "<i>Isn't</i> it nice?"</p>

</div>
<h2>MISTRESS MARY.</h2>


<p>IT was the first of May; but May was in an
April mood,&mdash;half cloudy, half shiny,&mdash;and
belied her name. Sprinkles of silvery rain
dotted the way-side dust; flashes of sun caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the drops as they fell, and turned each into a
tiny mirror fit for fairy faces. The trees were
raining too, showers of willow-catkins and
cherry-bud calyxes, which fell noiselessly and
strewed the ground. The children kicked the
soft brown drifts aside with their feet as they
walked along.</p>

<p>The doors of the Methodist meeting-house at
Valley Hill stood open, and crowds of men and
women and children were going into them. It
was not Sunday which called the people together:
it was the annual Conference meeting;
and all the country round was there to hear the
reports and learn where the ministers were to
be sent for the next two years. Methodist
clergymen, you know, are not "called" by the
people of the parish, as other clergymen are.
They go where the church sends them, and
every second year they are all changed to other
parishes. This, it is thought, keeps the people
and pastors fresh and interested in each other.
But I don't know. Human beings, as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
vegetables, have a trick of putting down roots;
and even a cabbage or a potato would resent
such transplanting, and would refuse to thrive.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when a parish has become attached
to its minister, it will plead to have him
stay longer. Now and then this request is
granted; but, as a rule, the minister has to go.
And it is a hard rule for his wife and children,
who have to go too.</p>

<p>The Valley Hill people "thought a heap" of
their minister, Mr. Forcythe, and had begged
hard that he might stay with them for another
term. Everybody belonging to the church had
come to the meeting feeling anxious, and yet
pretty certain that the answer would be favorable.
All over the building, people were whispering
about the matter, and heads were nodding
and bowing. The bonnets on these heads were
curiously alike. Mrs. Perry, the village milliner,
never had more than one pattern hat. "That is
what is worn," she said; and nobody disputed
the fact, which saved Mrs. Perry trouble. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Valley Hill people liked it just as well, and
didn't mind the lack of variety. This year Mrs.
Perry had announced yellow to be the fashion,
so nine out of ten of the hats present were
trimmed with yellow ribbon crossed in just the
same way over a yellow straw crown; and the
church looked like a bed of sisterly tulips nodding
and bowing in the wind.</p>

<p>Bishop Judson was the person to read the
announcements. He was a nice old man, kind
at heart, though formal in manner, and anxious
eyes were fixed on him as he got up with a
paper in his hand. That important little paper
held comfort or discomfort for ever so many
people. Every one bent forward to listen. It
was so still all over the church that you might
have heard a pin drop. The Bishop began with
a little speech about the virtues of patience and
contentment, and how important it was that
everybody should be quite satisfied whatever
happened to them. Then he opened the paper.</p>

<p>"Brother Johnson, Middlebury," he read.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Middlebury was a favorite parish, so Brother
Johnson looked pleased, and Sister Johnson was
congratulated by the friends who sat near her.
"Brother Woodward, Little Falls; Brother
Ashe, Plunxet; Brother Allen, Claxton Corners."
And so on. Some faces grew bright,
some sad, as the reading proceeded. At last
"Brother Forcythe, Redding; Brother Martin,
Valley Hill," was announced. A quiver of disappointment
went over the church, and a little
girl sitting in the gallery began to cry.</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear," whispered her mother,
much distressed at her sobs and gulps. People
looked up from below; but Mary could not
stop. She took her mother's handkerchief and
held it tight over her mouth; but the sobs
would come. Her heart was half-broken at the
idea of leaving Valley Hill and going to that
horrid Redding, where nobody wanted to go.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Clapp, from behind, reached over
and gave her a bunch of fennel. But the fennel
only made Mary cry harder. In Redding, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was sure, would be no kind Mrs. Clapp, no
"meeting-house seed;" and her sobs grew
thicker at the thought.</p>

<p>"I observe that your little daughter seems to
be distressed," said Bishop Judson, as Mrs. Forcythe
led the sobbing Mary down from the
gallery at the end of service. "Children of her
age form strong attachments to places, I am
aware. But it is well to break them before
they become unduly strong. Here we have no
continuing city, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," said poor Mrs. Forcythe, with a meek
sigh. She had been married fourteen years,
and this was her seventh move.</p>

<p>"Redding&mdash;hum&mdash;is a desirable place in
some respects," went on the Bishop. "There
is a great work to do there,&mdash;a great work. It
requires a man of Brother Forcythe's energy to
meet it. Mistress Mary here will doubtless find
consolation in the thought that her father's
sphere of usefulness is&mdash;h'm&mdash;enlarged."</p>

<p>"But we shan't have any garden," faltered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Mary, "Tilly Brooks, who was there before,
says it isn't a bit nice. She never saw a flower
all the time she was there, she said. I'd just
planted my bed in the garden here. Mrs.
Clapp gave me six pansies, and it was going to
be so pretty. Now I've got to&mdash;leave&mdash;'em."
Her voice died away into sobs.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said the Bishop. "The customs
of a church cannot be set aside to accommodate
a child's flower-bed. You'll find other things to
please you in Redding, Mistress Mary. Come,
come, dry your eyes. Your father's daughter
should not set an example like this."</p>

<p>"No, sir," gulped Mary, mortified at this reproof
from the Bishop, who was an important
person, and much looked up to. She did her
best to stop crying, but it was hard work.
When they reached home, the sight of the pansies
perking their yellow and purple faces up to
meet her, renewed her grief. There was her
mignonette seed not yet sprouted. If she had
known that they were going away, she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not have planted any. There, worst of all, was
the corner where she had planned such a nice
surprise for her mother,&mdash;"A. F." in green
parsley letters. A. F. stood for Anne Forcythe.
Now, mother would never see the letters or
know any thing about it. Oh dear, oh dear!</p>

<p>Mrs. Forcythe's own disappointment was
great, for they had all made sure that they
should stay. But, like a true mother, she put
her share of the grief aside, and thought only of
comforting Mary.</p>

<p>"Don't feel so badly, dear," she said. "Recollect,
you'll have Papa still, and me and Frank
and little Peter. We'll manage to be happy
somehow. Redding isn't half so disagreeable as
you think."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. Tilly said so. I was going to have
radishes and a rose-bush," replied Mary tearfully.
"There's a robin just building in the elm-tree
now. There won't be any trees in Redding;
only horrid hard cobble-stones."</p>

<p>"We must hope for the best," said Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Forcythe, who did not enjoy the idea of the
cobble-stones any more than Mary did.</p>

<p>"Only ten days more at Valley Hill," was
the first thought that came into Mary's mind
the next morning. She went downstairs cross
and out of spirits. Her mother was laying
sheets and table-cloths in a trunk. The books
were gone from the little book-shelf; every thing
had already begun to look unsettled and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I shall depend on you to take care of little
Peter," said Mrs. Forcythe. "We shall all have
to work hard if we are to get off next Monday
week."</p>

<p>Mary gave an impatient shrug with her shoulders.
She loved little Peter, but it seemed an
injury just then to have to take care of him.
All the time that her mother was sorting, counting,
and arranging where things should go, she
sat in the window sullen and unhappy, looking
out at the pansy-bed. Peter grew tired of a
companion who did nothing to amuse him, and
began to sprawl and scramble upstairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"O baby, come back!" cried Mary, and, I am
sorry to say, gave him a shake. Peter cried,
and that brought poor weary Mrs. Forcythe
downstairs.</p>

<p>"Can't you manage to make him happy?"
she said. Mary only pouted.</p>

<p>All that day and the next and the next it was
the same. Mrs. Forcythe was busy every moment.
There were a thousand things to do,
another thousand to remember. People kept
coming in to say good-by. Peter wandered out
on the door-steps when Mary's back was turned,
took cold, and was threatened with croup. Mrs.
Forcythe was half sick herself from worry and
fatigue. And all this time Mary, instead of
helping, was one of her mother's chief anxieties.
She fretted and complained continually. Every
thing went wrong. Each article put into the
boxes cost her a flood of tears. Each friend
who dropped in, renewed the sense of loss. She
scarcely noticed her mother's pale face at all.
All the brightness and busy-ness in her was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
changed for selfish lamentations, and still the
burden of her complaint was, "I shan't have
any flowers in Redding. My garden, oh, my
garden."</p>

<p>"I don't know what's come to her," said poor
Mrs. Forcythe. "She's not like the same child
at all." And old Mrs. Clapp, who had been very
fond of Mary, declared that she never knew a
girl so altered.</p>

<p>"She's the most <i>contrary</i> piece you ever saw,"
she said to her daughter. "I could have given
her a right-down good slap just now for the way
she spoke to her mother. It's all her fault that
the baby took cold. She don't lift a hand to help,
and I expect as sure as Fate that we'll have
Mrs. Forcythe sick before we get through. I
wouldn't have believed that such a likely girl as
Mary Forcythe could act so."</p>

<p>Poor "contrary" Mary! She was very unhappy.
The fatal last morning came. All the
boxes were packed. The drays, laden with furniture
and beds, stood at the gate. Mrs. Clapp,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and Mrs. Elder, the class-leader, were going over
the house collecting last things and doing last
jobs. Mary wandered out alone into the garden
for a farewell look at her pets.</p>

<p>"Good-by, pansies," she said, bending over
them. There were only five in the bed now,
for Mary had taken up one and packed it in
paper to carry with her. A big tear hopped
down her nose and splashed into the middle of
the yellow pansy, her favorite of all. It turned
up its bright kitten-face just the same. None
of them minded Mary's going away. Flowers
are sometimes so unkind to people.</p>

<p>"Good-by, rose-bush," proceeded Mary, turning
from the pansy-bed. "Good-by, honey-suckle.
Good-by, peony. Good-by, matter-i-mony."
This sounds funny, but Mary only meant by it
a vine with a small purple flower which grew
over the back-door. "Good-by, lilac," she went
on. "Good-by, grass plot." This brought her
to the gate. The wagon stood waiting to carry
them to the railroad, three miles away. Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Forcythe, with the baby in her arms, was just
getting in. "Hurry, Mary," called her father.
Slowly she opened the gate, slowly shut it.
Her father helped her over the wheel. She sat
down beside Frank. Mrs. Clapp waved her
handkerchief, then put it to her eyes. Mary
took a long look at the pretty garden just budding
with spring, and burst into tears. Mr.
Forcythe chirruped to the horse; they were off,&mdash;and
that was their good-by to Valley Hill.</p>

<p>Redding was certainly very different. It was
an old-fashioned town with narrow streets, which
smelt of fish. Most of the people were sailors,
or had something to do with ships. There were
several nice churches, and outside the town a
few handsome houses, but there were a great
many poor people in the place and not many
rich ones.</p>

<p>In the very narrowest of all the streets stood
the parsonage; a little brick house with a paved
yard behind, just wide enough for clothes-lines.
When the wash was hung out there was not an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
inch to spare on either side. Mary gave up all
hope as soon as she saw it. There was not
room even for <i>one</i> pansy. The windows looked
out on chimneys and roofs and other backyards,
with lines of wet clothes flapping in the sun. Not
a tree was to be seen. Any one might be excused
for thinking it doleful; and Mary, having made
up her mind beforehand to dislike it, found it
easy to keep her resolution.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of getting things to
rights that night; though several people came
in to help, and a comfortable supper was ready
spread for the travellers on their arrival. Mrs.
Forcythe was cheered by this kindness, but Mary
could not be cheerful. She had to sleep upon a
mattress laid on the floor. At another time this
would have been fun, but now it did not seem
funny at all; it was only part and parcel of the
misery of coming to live in Redding. She cried
herself to sleep, and came down in the morning
with swollen eyelids and a disposition to make
the very worst of things,&mdash;easy enough for any
girl to do if she sets about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>She scarcely thanked her father when he went
out and bought a red pot for the unlucky pansy,
which, after its travels and its night in brown
paper, looked as disconsolate as Mary herself.
"I know it'll die right away," she muttered as
she set it on the window-sill. "Oh, dear, there's
mother calling. What <i>does</i> she want?"</p>

<p>"Mary, dear," said Mrs. Forcythe when she
went down, "where have you been? I want
you to put away the dishes for me."</p>

<p>"I'm so tired," objected Mary crossly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that mother must be tired
too?" asked her father gravely.</p>

<p>Mary blushed and began to place the cups
and plates on the cupboard shelves. Her slow
movements attracted her father's attention.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he said. "At Valley
Hill you were as brisk as a bee, always wanting
to help in every thing. Here you seem
unwilling to move. How is it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;like&mdash;Redding," broke out
Mary in a burst of petulance.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen it yet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have, Papa. I've seen it as much
as I want to. It's horrid!"</p>

<p>"I never knew her to behave so before," said
Mr. Forcythe in a perplexed tone, as Mary,
having unpacked the dishes, sobbed her way
upstairs.</p>

<p>"She'll brighten when we are settled," replied
Mrs. Forcythe, indulgent as mothers are,
and ready to hope the best of her child. "Oh,
dear! there's the baby waked up. Would you
call Mary to go to him?"</p>

<p>So it went on all that week. Mr. and Mrs.
Forcythe were very patient with Mary, hoping
always that this evil mood would pass, and their
bright, helpful little daughter come back to them
again. She never refused to do any thing that
was asked of her; but you know the difference
between willing and unwilling service: Mary
just did the tasks set her, no more, and as soon
as they were finished fled to her own room to
fret and cry. Her father took her out to walk
and showed her the new church, but Mary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
thought the church ugly, and the outside view
of Redding as unpleasant as the inside one.
Dull streets, small houses everywhere; no gardens,
except now and then a single bed, edged
with a row of stiff cockle-shells by way of fence,
and planted with pert sweet-williams or crown
imperials. These Mary thought were worse
than no flowers at all. Every thing smelt of
fish. The very sea was made ugly by warehouses
and shabby wharves. The people they
met were strangers; and, altogether, the effect
of Mary's walk was to send her back more
homesick than ever for Valley Hill.</p>

<p>By Friday night the little parsonage was in
order. Mrs. Forcythe was a capital manager.
She planned and contrived, turned and twisted
and made things comfortable in a surprising
way. But she overtired herself greatly in doing
this, and on Saturday morning Mary was
waked by her father calling from below that
mother was very ill, and she must come down
at once and stay with her while he went for a
doctor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Mary, as she hurried on
her clothes. "Now mother is sick. It's all
this hateful Redding. She never was sick when
we lived in the country."</p>

<p>But the hard mood melted the moment she
saw her mother's pale face and feeble smile.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not going to be very ill," said
Mrs. Forcythe; "probably it's only that I have
tired myself out. You'll have to be 'Mamma'
for a day or two, Mary dear. Make Papa as
comfortable as you can. See that Frank has his
lunch put up for school, and don't let Peter take
cold. Oh, dear!&mdash;my head aches so hard that
I can't talk. I know you'll do your best Mary,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Guess how Mary felt at this appeal! All her
better nature came back in a moment. She
saw how wrong she had been in nursing her
selfish griefs, and letting this dear mother over-work
herself. "O mother, I will, indeed I
will!" she cried, kissing the pale face; and, only
waiting to draw the blind so that the sun should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
not shine in, she flew downstairs, eager to do all
she could to make up for past ill-conduct.</p>

<p>The Doctor came. He said Mrs. Forcythe
was threatened with fever, and must be kept
very quiet for several days. Mary had never
in her life worked so hard as she did that Saturday.
There was breakfast, dinner, supper to
get, dishes to wash, water to heat, the fire to
tend, rooms to dust, beds to make, the baby
to keep out of mischief. She was very tired by
night, but her heart felt lighter than it had for
many days past. Do you wonder at this? I
can tell you the reason. Mary's troubles were
selfish troubles, and the moment she forgot herself
in thinking of somebody else, they became
small and began to creep away.</p>

<p>"Pitty, pitty!" said little Peter, as he heard
her singing over her dish-washing. Mary caught
him up and gave him a hearty kiss,&mdash;a real
Valley Hill kiss, such as she had given no one
since they came to Redding.</p>

<p>"Mary is doing famously," Mr. Forcythe told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
his wife that night. "She has a first-rate head
on her shoulders for a girl of her age." Mary
heard him, and was pleased. She liked&mdash;we
all like&mdash;to be counted useful and valuable.
The bit of praise sent her back to her work
with redoubled zeal.</p>

<p>Next morning Mrs. Forcythe was a little better.
Her head ached less; she sat up on her pillows
and drank a cup of tea. Mary was smoothing
her mother's hair with soft pats of the brush,
when suddenly the church bells began to ring.
She had never heard such sounds before. The
bell at Valley Hill was cracked, and went tang&mdash;tang&mdash;tang,
as if the meeting-house were
an old cow walking slowly about. These bells
had a dozen different voices,&mdash;some deep and
solemn, others bright and clear, but all beautiful;
and across their pealing a soft, delicious
chime from the tower of the Episcopal church
went to and fro, and wove itself in and out like
a thread of silver embroidery. Mary dropped
the brush, and clasped her hands tight. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
like listening to a song of which she could not
hear enough. When the last tinkle of the
chime died away, she unclasped her hands, and,
turning from the window, cried, "O mother!
wasn't that lovely? There is <i>one</i> pleasant
thing in Redding, after all!"</p>

<p>I do not think matters ever seemed so hard
again after that morning when Mary made
friends with the church bells. It was the beginning
of a better understanding between her
and her new home; and there is a great deal in
beginnings, even though they may work slowly
toward their ends.</p>

<p>By the close of the week Mrs. Forcythe was
downstairs again, weak and pale, but able to
sit in her chair and direct things, which Mary
felt to be a great comfort. The parishioners
began to call. There were no rich people
among them; but it was a hard-working, active
parish, and did a great deal for its means. The
Sunday-school was large and flourishing; there
was a missionary association, a home missionary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
association, a mite society, and a sewing
circle, which met every week to make clothes
for the poor and partake of tea, soda biscuit,
and six sorts of cake. Beside these, a new
project had just been started, "The Seamen's
Daughters' Industrial Society;" or, in other
words, a sewing-school for little girls whose
fathers were sailors. There were plenty of
such little girls in Redding.</p>

<p>"Your daughter will join, of course," said
Mrs. Wallis, when she came to call on her
minister's wife. "It's important that the pastor's
family should take a part in every good
work." Mrs. Wallis was the most energetic
woman of the congregation,&mdash;at the head of
every thing.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mary's sewing is not good
enough," replied Mrs. Forcythe. "She isn't
very skilful with her needle yet."</p>

<p>"Oh! she knows enough to teach those
ignorant little creatures. Half of them are
foreigners, and never touch a needle in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
homes. It's every thing to give them some
ideas beyond their own shiftless ways."</p>

<p>"Would you like to try, Mary?" asked her
mother.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know," replied Mary, afraid to
refuse, because Mrs. Wallis looked so sharp and
decided.</p>

<p>"Very well, then I'll call for you on Saturday,
at half-past ten," went on Mrs. Wallis,
quite regardless of Mary's hesitating tone.
"I'm glad you'll come. It would never do not
to have some of the minister's family. Saturday
morning, at half-past ten! Good-by, Mrs.
Forcythe. Don't get up; you look peaked
still. To-morrow is baking day, and I shall
send you a green-currant pie. Perhaps <i>that'll</i>
do you good." With these words she departed.</p>

<p>"Must I really teach in that school?" asked
Mary dolefully.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better. The people expect
it, and it will be a good thing for you to practise
sewing a little," replied her mother. "I
daresay it will be pleasanter than you think."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems so funny that I should be set to
teach any one to sew," said Mary, bursting into
a laugh. "Don't you recollect how Mrs. Clapp
used to scold me, and say I 'gobbled' my
darns?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't 'gobble' before the seamen's
daughters," said Mrs. Forcythe, smiling. "It
will be a capital lesson for you to try to teach
what you haven't quite learned yourself."</p>

<p>Punctual as the clock Mrs. Wallis appeared
on Saturday, and bore the unwilling Mary away
to the sewing-school. Mrs. Forcythe watched
them from the window. She couldn't help
laughing, their movements were so comically
different,&mdash;Mrs. Wallis was so brisk and decided,
while Mary lagged behind, dragging one
slow foot after the other as if each moment she
longed to stop and dared not. Very different
was her movement, however, two hours later,
when she returned. She came with a kind of
burst, her eyes bright with excitement, and her
cheeks pinker than they had been since she left
Valley Hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"O mother, it is <i>so</i> nice! Ever so many
children were there,&mdash;thirty at least; and Mrs.
Wallis said I might choose any five I liked to
be my class. First, I chose the dearest little
Irish girl. Her name is Norah, and she's just
as pretty as she can be, only her face was
dreadfully dirty, and her clothes all rags. Then
her little sister Kathleen cried to come; so I
took her too. Then I chose a cunning little
German tot named Gretchen. She has yellow
hair, braided in tight little tails down her back,
and is a good deal cleaner than the rest, but not
very clean, you know; and she hadn't any shoes
at all. Then Mrs. Wallis brought up the funniest
little French girl, with a name I can't pronounce.
I'm going to call her Amy. And the
last of all is an American, real pretty. Her
name is Rachel Gray. Her father is gone on a
whaling voyage, and won't be back for three
years. Don't they sound nice, mother? I
think I shall like teaching them so much!"</p>

<p>"Do they know any thing about sewing?"
asked Mrs. Forcythe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a thing. They made dreadful stitches.
Kathleen cried because the needle pricked her,
and Rachel wanted to wear the thimble on the
wrong finger. Amy did the best. When they
went away they all wanted to kiss me, and
Norah said she guessed I was the best teacher
in the school. Wasn't that cunning? Mrs.
Wallis is real kind. She brought ever so much
gingerbread, and gave each of the children a
piece."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it begins so well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. There's just one thing, though. The
children's faces! You can't think how dirty
they are. I should like to give them a good
scrub all round."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you?"</p>

<p>"How can I? There isn't any wash-bowl
down at the school-room."</p>

<p>"If you liked you might have them all come
here at ten o'clock, and walk down with you.
Then you could take them up to your room,
wash their faces and hands, and brush their hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
smooth before you start. I really think you
would enjoy your teaching more if the scholars
were clean."</p>

<p>"May I really do that?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll buy you a fresh cake of soap and
a brush, and you can take two clean towels from
the drawer every Saturday morning. Make it
a rule, but be very gentle and pleasant about it
or the children may refuse."</p>

<p>"O mother, what a good plan! Thank you
so much," said Mary with sparkling eyes. "Now
I shall have real comfort with them."</p>

<p>There was great excitement in the sewing-class
when they were told that in future they
were to go to "Teacher's" house every Saturday,
and walk down to school with her. They
were a droll little procession enough when they
appeared the next week at the appointed time.
Norah's toes were out of her shoes. Her tangled
curls were as rough as a bird's-nest, and the
hat on top of them looked as if it had sailed
across every mud-puddle in town. Little Kathleen's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
scanty garments were rather rags than
clothes. And Gretchen, tidiest of all, had
smears of sausage on her rosy face, and did not
seem to have been brought into contact with
soap and water for weeks.</p>

<p>Mary led them up into her own room, which,
plain as it was, looked like a palace to the little
ones after the dirt and discomfort of their
crowded homes. There were the nice clean
towels, the new hair-brush, and the big cake of
honey-soap, mother's contributions to the undertaking.
The washing was quite a frolic. Norah
cried a little at having her hair pulled, but
Mary was gentle and pleasant, and made the
affair so amusing that the children thought it
pleasant to be clean, instead of disliking it.
She rewarded their patience by a kiss all round.
Kathleen threw her arms about Mary's neck
and gave her a great hug. "You're iver so
nice," she said, and Mary kissed her again.</p>

<p>So every Saturday from that time forward,
Mary went to school followed by a crowd of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
clean little faces, which looked all the brighter
and happier for their cleanliness. She was
proud of her class, but their ragged clothes distressed
her greatly.</p>

<p>"It is such a pity," she told her mother.
"They are so pretty, and they look like beggars."</p>

<p>Mrs. Forcythe had only been waiting for this.
She was not a woman to give much advice, even
to her own child. "Drop in a seed and let it
grow," was her motto.</p>

<p>"There's that old gingham of yours," she
suggested. "You could spare that for one of
them, if there were anybody to make it over."</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> make it!" cried Mary, "only&mdash;" her,
face falling, "I don't know how to cut dresses."</p>

<p>"I'll cut it for you if you like," said Mrs.
Forcythe quietly.</p>

<p>"Will you, mother dear? How splendid.
I'll make it for Norah. She's the raggedest of
all."</p>

<p>The gingham was measured, and proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
enough to make frocks for Norah and Kathleen
too. Mary had double work to undertake, but
her heart was in her fingers, and they flew fast.
It took every spare moment for a fortnight to
make the frocks, but when they were done and
tried on to the delighted children, they looked
so nicely that Mary was rewarded for her trouble
and for the many needle-pricks in her forefinger.</p>

<p>"Only it's such a pity about the others," she
told her mother. "They'll think I'm partial,
and I'm not, though I <i>do</i> love Norah a little bit
the best, she's so affectionate. I wish we were
rich. Then I could buy frocks for them all."</p>

<p>"If you were rich, perhaps you wouldn't
care about it," said her mother. "A little here
and a little there, a stitch, a kind word, a small
self-denial, these are in the power of all of us,
and in course of time they mount up and make
a great deal. And, Mary dear, I've always found
if you once start in a path and are determined
to keep on, somebody's sure to come along and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
lend a helping hand, when you think you have
got to the end of every thing, and must stop or
turn back."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got to the end of every thing
now," said Mary. "There aren't any more
old frocks to make over, and we can't afford to
buy new ones."</p>

<p>"Don't be discouraged," said her mother.
"The way is sure to open somehow."</p>

<p>"How wise mother is," thought Mary, when
the very next week on their way back from
school Mrs. Wallis said, "I noticed that two of
your scholars had respectable frocks on to-day.
I wonder if their mothers made them? If they
did, I've an old chintz dress which I could spare,
and perhaps Gretchen's mother and Amadine's
could take it and fit them out too."</p>

<p>"I made the dresses," cried Mary joyfully.
"And if you'll let me have the old chintz, I'll
make some more for the others, Mrs. Wallis.
Oh, I'm so glad."</p>

<p>"Did you make them," said Mrs. Wallis in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
pleased tone. "Well, that's first-rate. I'll send
the chintz round to-night; and any other old
things I can find to help along."</p>

<p>So that night came a great bundle, which, on
opening, revealed not only the chintz, but a nice
calico, some plaid ribbon, a large black alpaca
apron, and an old shirt of Mr. Wallis's. Such a
busy time as Mary had in planning how to make
the most of these gifts. The chintz was long
and full. It had a cape, and made two beautiful
frocks. The calico made another frock and
two nice pinafores, the black alpaca some small
aprons. Mary trimmed the two worst hats with
the ribbon. Last of all, she cut and stitched five
narrow bands of the linen, which mother washed
and starched, and behold, the class had collars!
I don't know which was most pleased at this
last decoration, Mary or the children.</p>

<p>"They are just as good as dolls to you, aren't
they," said her father.</p>

<p>"O Papa! much better than <i>that</i>. Dolls can't
laugh and talk, and they don't really care any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
thing about you, you only just make believe
that they do. It's horrid to fit a doll's clothes;
she sticks her arm out stiff and won't bend it a
bit. I'd rather have my class than all the dolls
in the world."</p>

<p>"Teaching those children is having a capital
effect on Mary herself," said Mrs. Forcythe to
her husband after Mary had gone away. "She
gains all the time in patience and industry, and
is twice as careful of her things as she used to
be. I found her crying the other day because
she had torn her oldest frock, and the darn
was sure to come in a bad place when the frock
was made over for Gretchen! Think of Mary's
crying because of having torn any thing!"</p>

<p>Time flies rapidly when people are busy and
happy. Days crept into weeks, weeks into
months; before any one knew it two years
were passed and another Conference day was
at hand. It met this time at Redding.</p>

<p>Mary, a tall girl of fifteen now, went with
her mother to hear the appointments read.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The Redding people had applied to keep Mr.
Forcythe for another term, but the request was
denied; and, when his name was reached on the
list, it appeared that he was to go back to Valley
Hill.</p>

<p>"There's one person I know will be pleased,"
said the Bishop, pausing on his way out of
church to speak to Mrs. Forcythe. "Mistress
Mary here! She'll be glad to go back to Valley
Hill again. But, hey-day! she doesn't look
glad. What! tears in her eyes. How is this?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know&mdash;" sighed Mary. "I
thought&mdash;I thought we should stay here. Of
course I feel sorry just at first."</p>

<p>"Sorry! Not want to leave Redding! Why,
what a contrary little maid you are! Don't you
recollect how you cried, and said Redding was
horrid."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary, on the verge of a sob.
"But I like it now, Bishop. I don't mind the
fish a bit, and the funny old streets and the posy-beds
with cockle-shell edges are so nice, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the bells sound so sweet on Sunday morning!&mdash;I
like Redding ever so much."</p>

<p>"But your garden,&mdash;I remember how badly
you felt to leave that. You can't have a garden
in Redding."</p>

<p>"No, but I have my little girls. I'd rather
have them than a garden, a great deal!"</p>

<p>"What does she mean?" asked the Bishop,
turning to Mrs. Forcythe.</p>

<p>"Her sewing-class," replied Mrs. Forcythe,
smiling.</p>

<p>"There they are!" cried Mary eagerly.
"They're waiting for me. Do look at them,
Bishop; it's those five little girls in a row behind
the second pillar from the door. That big
one is Norah, and the one in blue is Rachel,
and the littlest is named Kathleen. Isn't she
pretty? They're the sweetest little things, oh,
I shall miss them so. I shan't ever have such
good times again as I've had with them." Her
voice faltered; a lump came in her throat. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
hide it she slipped away, and went across the
church to where the little ones sat.</p>

<p>"That's a dear child of yours," said the good
Bishop, looking after her. "I guess she'll <i>do</i>
wherever she goes."</p>

<p>And I think Mary will.</p>

<h2>LADY BIRD.</h2>


<p>"NOW, Pocahontas Maria, sit still and don't disturb
the little ones. Imogene, that lesson must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
be learned before I come back, you know. Now,
dear, that was very, very naughty. When
Mamma tells you to do things you mustn't pout
and poke Stella with your foot in that way.
It isn't nice at all. Stella is younger than you,
and you ought to set her samples, as Nursey
says. Look at Ning Po Ganges, how good she
is, and how she minds all I say, and yet she's
the littlest child I've got."</p>

<p>If anybody had been walking in Madam
Bird's old-fashioned garden that morning, and
had heard these wise words coming from the
other side of the rose thicket, he would certainly
have supposed that some old dame with
a school was hidden away there, or at the least an
anxious Mamma with a family of unruly children.
But if this somebody had gone into the thicket,
bobbing his head to avoid the prickly, wreath-like
branches, he would have found on the other
side only one person, little Lota Bird, playing
all alone with her dolls. "Lady Bird" Nursey
called Lota, because when, six years before,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Papa fetched her home from China, she wore
a speckled frock of orange-red and black, very
much the color of those other tiny frocks in
which the real lady-birds fly about in summer-time.
The speckled frock was outgrown long
ago, but the name still clung to Lota, and every
one called her by it except Grandmamma, who
said "Charlotte," sighing as she spoke, and
Papa, whose letters always began, "My darling
little Lota." Papa had been away so long now
that Lota would quite have forgotten him had it
not been for these letters which came regularly
every month. The paper on which they were
written had an odd, pleasant smell. Nurse said
it was the smell of sandal-wood. Sometimes
there were things inside for Lota, bird's feathers
of gay colors, Chinese puzzles of carved ivory,
or small pictures painted on rice paper. Lota
liked these things very much. It was like playing
at a Papa rather than really having one, but
she enjoyed the play; and when they told her
that Papa was soon coming home to stay always,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
she was only half glad, and said: "Won't there
be any more letters then? I shan't like that."
Poor little girlie: we, who know how nice it
is to have real Papas, can feel sorry for her;
can't we?</p>

<p>But Lota did not pity herself in the least.
Grandmamma's house was stiff and gloomy,
shaded by high trees and thick vines which jealously
shut out the sun whenever he tried to shine
in at the window panes. Grandmamma's servants
were old too, like the house. Most of them had
gray hair. Nursey wore spectacles; the coachman
indulged in rheumatism. Grandmamma
herself was old and feeble. She rarely laughed
or seemed to enjoy any thing, but sat in an easy
chair all the year round, and read solemn books
bound in black leather, which made her cry.
Jennings her maid waited on her, fetched footstools
and cushions, pushed the blinds down as
soon as the cheerful noon got round to that side
of the house. "Missus is uncommon poorly to-day,"
she announced every morning. "Miss, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
must be very quiet." Lota was quiet. She was
the only young thing in the sad old house, but
the shadows of age and sorrow fell lightly upon
her, and in spite of them she was as happy a
child as you will find in a summer's day. The
garden was her kingdom and her Paradise. It
was a wide, fragrant, shaded place, full of the
shrubs and flowers of former days. Huge pink
and white oleanders, planted in tubs, stood on
either side the walks. Thick spikes of purple
lavender edged the beds; the summer-house was
a tangle of honey-suckle, rosemary, and eglantine.
Roses of all colors abounded. They towered
high above Lota's head as she walked,&mdash;twined
and clasped, shut her in with perfumed shadows,
rained showers of many-colored petals on the
grass. An old-fashioned fairy would have delighted
to dwell in that garden, and perhaps one
did dwell there, else why should little lonely
Lota have been always so very, very happy left
alone among the trees and flowers? Can any
one tell me that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Far up in the curved angle made by the rose-hedge
was the little house where she and her
dollies lived. Jacob the gardener built this house,
of roots and willow-osiers curiously twisted. It
was just big enough for Lady Bird and her
family. The walls were pasted over with gay
prints cut from the "Illustrated News" and other
papers. There was a real window. The moss
floor had a blue cotton rug laid over it. A
small table and chair for Lota and one apiece
for the dolls made up the furniture, beside a
shelf on which the baby-house tea-set was displayed.
The roof kept out the weather pretty
well, except when it rained hard; then things
got wet. Here Lota sat all the morning, after
she had finished her lessons with Nursey,&mdash;short
lessons always, and easy ones, by Papa's particular
request, for the doctors had said that Lota
must not study much till she was really big and
strong. Pocahontas Maria and the other children
had to work much harder than their Mamma,
I assure you. Lota was very strict with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
When they were idle she put them into the corner,
and made them sit with their faces to the
wall by way of punishment. Once Lota had the
measles, and for two whole weeks was kept
away entirely from the garden-house. When
she came back, she found that during all this
time poor little Ning-Po Ganges had been sitting
in this ignominious position with her face
hidden. Lota cried with remorse at this, and
promised Ning-Po that never, so long as she
lived, should she be put into the corner again;
so after that, for convenience' sake, Ning-Po was
always called the best child in the family. Now
and then, when Lota felt hospitable, she would
give a tea-party, and ask Lady Green and her
children from under the snow-ball bush next
door. Nobody but Lota and the dolls could see
the Greens, even when they sat about the table
talking and being talked to, but that was no
matter; and when Nursey said, "Law, Miss
Lady Bird, how can you; there's never any
such people, you know," Lota would point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
triumphantly to a card tacked on to the snow-ball
bush, which had "Lady Green" printed on
it, and would say, "Naughty Nursey! can't you
read? There's her door-plate!"</p>

<p>As this story is all about Lota, I think I
would better tell you just how she spent one
week of her life, she and the dolls.</p>

<p>The week began with Sunday, which was
always a dull day, because Lota was forbidden
to go into the garden.</p>

<p>In the morning she went to church with
Grandmamma, drawn thither by two fat old black
horses, who seemed to think it almost too much
trouble to switch the flies off with their tails.
Church was warm and the sermon was drowsy,
so poor Lady Bird fell asleep, and tumbled over
suddenly on to Grandmamma's lap. This distressed
the old lady a good deal, for she was
very particular about behavior in church. By
way of punishment, Lota had to learn four verses
of a hymn after dinner. It was the hymn which
begins,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Awake, my soul, and with the sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thy daily course of duty run,"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>and learning it took all the time from dinner
till four o'clock.</div>

<p>The hymn learned and repeated, Lota read
for awhile in one of her Sunday books. She was
ashamed of her sleepiness in the morning, and
had every intention of being very good till bedtime;
but unluckily she looked across to where
the dolls were sitting, and, as she explained to
Nursey afterward, Pocahontas Maria was whispering
to Imogene, and both of them were
laughing so hard and looking so mischievous
that she <i>had</i> to see what was the matter. Result;&mdash;at
five, Jennings, coming to call Lota,
found her with all the dolls in a row before
her teaching them hymns. And, though this
seems most proper, Jennings, who was a strict
Methodist, did not think so; so Lota had another
lecture from Grandmamma, and went to
bed under a sense of disgrace. So much for
Sunday.</p>

<p>Monday opened with bright sunshine. It
had rained all night; but by eleven o'clock the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
dear old garden was quite dry, and how sweet
it did look! The pink roses twinkled and
winked their whisker-like calyxes as she went
by; the white ones shook their serene leaves,
and sent out delicious smells. Every green
thing looked greener than it had done before
the rain. The blue sky, swept clear of clouds,
seemed to have been rubbed and made brilliant.
It was a day for gardens; and Lady Bird and
her family celebrated it by a picnic, to which
they invited all the Greens.</p>

<p>"Lady Green hasn't treated me quite properly,"
remarked Lota to her oldest child, Pocahontas.
"She didn't leave her card at this
house I don't know when. But we won't mind
about that, because it's such a nice day, and
we want the picnic. And we can't have the
picnic without the Greens, you know, dear,
because there aren't any other people to invite."</p>

<p>So they had the picnic,&mdash;a delightful one.
The young Greens behaved badly. They almost
always did behave badly when they came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
see Lady Bird; but it was rather a good thing,
because she could warn her own children that,
if they did the same, they would be severely
punished. "Lady Green is too indulgent,"
she would say. "I want <i>my</i> children to be
much gooder than hers. Mind that, Imogene."
So, on this occasion, when Clarissa Green
snatched at the rose-cakes which formed the
staple of the feast, Lota looked very sharply at
Stella, and said, "Don't let me ever see you do
so, Stella, or I shall have to slap your little
hands." Stella heeded the warning, and sat
upright as a poker and perfectly still.</p>

<p>Clarissa was perhaps not so much to blame,
for the rose-cakes were delicious. Would you
like Lady Bird's recipe? Any little girl can
make them. Take a good many rose-leaves;
put some sugar with them,&mdash;as much sugar
as you can get; tie them up in paper, or in
a good thick grape-leaf; lay them on a bench,
and <i>sit down on them hard several times</i>:
then they are done. Some epicures pretend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that they must be buried in the ground, and
left there for a week; but this takes time, and
reasonable children will find them quite good
enough without. These particular rose-cakes
were the best Lota had ever made. The whole
party, Greens and all, agreed to that. For the
rest of the feast there was a motto-paper, which
had ornamented several picnics before. It could
not be eaten, but it looked well sitting in the
middle of the table. At the close of the banquet
all the party sang a song. Lady Green's
voice was not very good, but Lota explained
to the children afterward that it isn't polite
to laugh at company even when they do make
funny squeaks with their high notes. Pocahontas
had to sit in the corner awhile for having
done so. She was sorry, and promised never
to offend again; as a reward for which, her
Mamma gave her a small blank book made of
writing-paper and a pin, which she told her was
for her very own.</p>

<p>"You are such a big girl now," said Mamma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Lota, "that it is time you began to keep a
Diary like I do. I shall read it over every day,
and see how you spell."</p>

<p>Here is Pocahontas Maria's journal as it stood
on Tuesday afternoon, after the children had
done their lessons and had their dinners:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tuseday. I am going to keep a Diry like
Mamma's. Studded as usel. Mamma said I
was cairless, and didn't get my jography lesson
propperly. Stella had hers better than me. I
hurt my ellbow against the table. It won't
bend any more. Mamma is going to get Doctor
Jacob to put in a woulden pin. I hope it won't
hurt."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pocahontas! Pocahontas!" cried the
scandalized Lady Bird as she read this effusion.
"After all the pains I have taken, to think you
should spell so horridly as this." Then she sat
down and corrected all the words. "I don't wonder
your cheeks are so red," she said severely.
Pocahontas sat up straight and blushed, but
made no excuses. It is not strange that Lota,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
who really spelt very nicely for a little girl of
her age, should have been shocked.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night it rained again, and the
sun got up in a cloud next morning, and seemed
uncertain whether or not to shine. Grandmamma
was going to drive out to make a call, and Jennings
came early to the nursery to tell Nurse to
dress Lady Bird nicely, so that she might go too.
Accordingly Nursey put on Lota's freshest white
cambric and her best blue sash, and laid a pair
of white gloves and a little hat trimmed with
blue ribbons and forget-me-nots on the bed, so
that they might be ready when the carriage
came to the door. "Now, Miss Lady Bird, you
must sit still and keep yourself very nice," she
said. This was hard, for the children had all
been left in the garden-house the night before,
and Lota wanted very much to see them. She
stood at the window looking wistfully out. By
and by the sun flashed gloriously from the clouds,
and sent a bright ray right into her eyes. It
touched the rain-drops which hung over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
bushes, and instantly each became a tiny mimic
sun, sending out separate rays of its own. Lota
forgot all about Nursey's injunctions. "I'll just
run out one minute and fetch little Ning-Po in,"
she thought. "That child's too delicate to be
left out in the damp. She catches cold so
easily; really it quite troubles me sometimes
the way she coughs."</p>

<p>So down the garden walk she sped. The
shrubs, shaken by her swift passage, scattered
showers of bright drops upon the white frock
and the pretty sash. But Lota didn't mind or
notice. The air and sun, the clear, fresh feeling,
the birds' songs, filled her with a kind of
intoxication. Her head spun, her feet danced
as she ran along. Suddenly a cold feeling at
the toes of her bronze boots startled her. She
looked down. Behold, she was in a pool of
water, left by the rain in a hollow of the gravel-walk.
Was she frightened? Not at all. The
water felt delightfully fresh, her spirits flashed
out like the sun himself, and in the joy of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
heart she began to waltz, scattering and splashing
the water about her. The crisp ruffles of
the cambric lost all their starch, the pretty boots
were quite spoiled, but Lota waltzed on, and in
this plight Nursey, flying indignantly out from
the kitchen door, found her naughty pet.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Charlotte, I <i>am</i> discouraged," she
said, as she pulled off the wet things. "Waltzing
in a mud-puddle! That's nice work for a
young lady! I am discouraged, Miss Charlotte."</p>

<p>Nursey never said "Miss Charlotte" except
on the most solemn occasions, so Lota knew
that she was very vexed. She should have
been cast down by this, but somehow she was
not.</p>

<p>"But <i>I'm</i> not discouraged," she replied.
"I'm not discouraged a bit! And the birds
aren't discouraged! They sang all the while
I was waltzing in the mud-puddle, Nursey; I
heard 'em!"</p>

<p>Nursey gave it up. She loved Lady Bird
dearly, and could not hear to scold her or to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
have any one else do so. So she made haste to
change the unlucky frock and shoes, so that she
should be neat and trim whenever Grandmamma
sent for her. I suppose this forbearance touched
Lota's heart, for at the last moment she turned,
ran back, threw her arms round Nursey's neck,
and whispered, "I'm sorry, and I'll never waltz
in mud-puddles again." Nursey squeezed her
hard by way of answer. "Precious lamb!" she
said, and Lota ran downstairs quite happy.</p>

<p>The lady whom Grandmamma drove out to
see, had a little granddaughter visiting her.
Isabel Bernard was her name. She came from
the city, and was so beautifully dressed and so
well-mannered, that Grandmamma took quite a
fancy to her, and invited her to spend a day
with Lota.</p>

<p>"Charlotte will enjoy a young companion,"
said Grandmamma. So the next day was fixed
upon.</p>

<p>This was a very exciting event for the Bird
family, who rarely had any visitors except Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Green, who did not count, being such a near
neighbor. Pocahontas wrote in her journal,
"A grand lady is coming to see Mamma. Me
and all of us are going to have on our best
frocks. I hope she'll think us pretty;" and
though Lota told her that little girls ought not
to mind about being pretty if only they obey
their mammas and are good, the sentiment was
so natural that she really hadn't the heart to
scold the child much. The baby-house was
swept and garnished for the occasion, a fresh
batch of rose-cakes was made, and a general air
of festivity pervaded the premises.</p>

<p>Lota hoped that Isabel would come early,
soon after breakfast, so as to have a longer day;
but it was quite twelve o'clock before she made
her appearance, all alone by herself in a huge
barouche, which made her seem scarcely larger
than a doll. She wore a fine frilled muslin
frock over blue silk, a white hat, and dainty
lemon-colored boots. When Lota, feeling shy
at the spectacle of this magnificence, proposed
going into the garden, she hung back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that it isn't damp?" she
said, "because&mdash;you see&mdash;this is my best
frock."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite sure," pleaded Lota. "The grass
was cut only day before yesterday, and Jacob
rolled the gravel last night. Do come! The
children want to see you so much."</p>

<p>"The children!" said Isabel, surprised. But
when she saw the doll-family sitting in a row
with their best clothes on, and their four pairs
of fixed blue eyes looking straight before them,
she laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"Do you play with dolls?" she asked. "I
gave them up long ago."</p>

<p>Lady Bird's eyes grew large with distress.
"Oh, don't call them <i>that</i>," she cried. "I never
do. It hurts their feelings so. You can't think."</p>

<p>Isabel laughed again. She wasn't at all a
nice girl to play with. The rose-cakes she pronounced
"nasty." When Lota explained about
Lady Green, she stared and said it was ridiculous,
and that there was no such person. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
turned up her nose at Pocahontas's journal, and
declared that Lota wrote it herself! "Did you
ever hear of such a thing?" asked Lady Bird
afterward of Lady Green. "As if my child
could not write!" It was just so all day. The
only thing Isabel seemed to enjoy was dining in
state with Grandmamma, and answering all her
questions with the air of a little grown-up
woman. Grandmamma said she was a very well-behaved
child, and she wished Charlotte would
take pattern by her. But Lota didn't agree
with Grandmamma. She hoped with all her heart
that Isabel would never come to visit her again.</p>

<p>Pocahontas Maria wrote in her journal next
day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The lady who came to see Mamma wasn't
very nice, I think. She didn't even speak to
us children, and she made fun at my diry. We
didn't like her a bit. Stella says she's horrid,
and Ning-Po hopes Mamma won't ever ask her
any more." Lady Bird reproved Pocahontas
very gravely for these sentiments, and reminded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
her again that "diry" is not the way to spell
diary; but she said to Lady Green, who dropped
in for a call, "Poor little thing, I don't wonder!
children always find out when people isn't nice;
and Isabel, she <i>was</i> very disagreeable, you know,
calling them 'dolls' and things like that! It's
not surprising that they didn't like her, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>Saturday was an eventful day. There were
no lessons to do for one thing, because Nursey's
daughter had come to see her, and Grandmamma
said Lady Bird might be excused for once.
This gave her the whole morning to attend to
domestic matters, which was nice, or would have
been, only unluckily little Stella took this opportunity
to break out with measles. Of course
Lady Bird was much distressed. She put Stella
to bed at once, and sent the others to the farthest
side of the room lest they should catch the
disease also, "though," as she told Pocahontas,
"You'll be sure to have it. It always runs
straight through families; the doctor said so <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wh  '">when</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
I had it; and whatever I shall do with all of you
on my hands at once, I can't imagine." There is
always a great deal to do in times of sickness, so
this was a very busy day. Lota had to make
broth for Stella, to concoct medicine out of
water and syringa-stems, to prepare dinner for
the other children, and hear all their lessons, for
of course education must not be neglected let
who will have measles! Pocahontas was unusually
troublesome. Imogene cried over the spelling
lesson; and altogether Lady Bird had her
hands full that morning.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly send you all away to boarding-school
if you don't learn to behave better,"
she cried in despair, at which awful threat the
children wept aloud and promised to be good.
Then came dinner,&mdash;real dinner, I mean,&mdash;which
Lady Bird could scarcely eat, so anxious
was she about her sick child in the garden. The
moment it was over back she flew, oblivious of
the charms of raisins and almonds. Stella was
asleep, but she evidently had fever, for her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
cheeks were bright pink, and her lips as red as
sealing-wax.</p>

<p>"I must have a doctor for her," cried poor
Lady Bird.</p>

<p>She tried to think what article would be
best to choose for the doctor, and fixed on an
old black muff of Nursey's which lived on the
shelf of the nursery closet. To get it, however,
it was needful to leave the children again.</p>

<p>"You must all be good," she said, fussing
about and tidying the room, "very good and
very quiet, so as not to wake up Stella. Dear
me, what a queer smell there is here! Let me
think. What did Nursey do when I had measles?
She burned some sort of paper and made it smell
nice again. I must burn some paper too, else
Stella'll suffocate, won't you, dear?"</p>

<p>No sooner thought than done. Jacob had
left his coat hanging near the tool-house while
he went to dinner, and he always carried matches
in his pipe-pocket. Lady Bird knew that. She
put her hand in and drew one out, feeling guilty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
for one of Nursey's chief maxims was, "Never
touch matches, Lady Bird; remember what I
say, never!"</p>

<p>"If Nursey knew about Stella's having the
measles she'd say different," she soliloquized.</p>

<p>There was a good-sized bit of brown paper in
the garden-house. Lota rolled it up, laid it
near the bedside, lit the edge, and carefully blew
out the match. The paper did not flame, but
smouldered slowly, sending up a curl of smoke.
Lady Bird gazed at it with much satisfaction,
then, with a last kiss to Stella, she went away to
fetch the doctor, stopping at Lady Green's door
as she passed, to tell her that she had better not
let any of her children come over, because they
might catch the measles and be sick too.</p>

<p>It took some time to rummage out the muff,
for Nursey had tucked it far back on the shelf
behind other things. There was nobody in the
nursery. Something unusual seemed to be
going on downstairs, for doors were opening
and shutting, and persons were talking and exclaiming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Lota paid no attention to this; her
head was full of her own affairs, and she had no
time to spend on other people's. Muff in hand,
she hastened down the garden walk. As she
drew near she smelt smoke, and smiled with
satisfaction. But the smell grew stronger, and
the air was blue and thick. She became alarmed,
and began to run. Another moment, and the
house was in sight. Smoke was pouring from
the door, from the window, and&mdash;what was that
red thing which darted out from the smoke like
a long tongue? Oh, Lady Bird! Lady Bird! fly,
hasten, your house is on fire, and there are the
children inside with none but you to aid them!</p>

<p>Did ever mother hesitate when her little ones
were in danger? Lady Bird did not. With
a shriek of affright she plunged boldly into the
midst of the smoke. An awful sight met her eyes
through the open door. The wall-paper was on
fire, the cotton rug, the table-cover! Little red
flames were creeping up the valance of the crib
in which poor sick Stella lay! The other children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
were sitting in a row opposite, very calm
and still, but blisters had begun to form on
Imogene's waxen cheeks, and a cinder, lodged
on Ning-Po's flaxen wig, was scorching and
singeing. What a spectacle to meet a mother's
eyes! Oh, Lady Bird, haste to the rescue!</p>

<p>She did not falter. In the twinkling of an
eye she had dashed into the burning room, had
caught Stella from her bed, the others from their
chairs, and with all four hugged tight to her
heart was making for the door. Ah! a spark
fell on the white apron, on the holland frock!
Her rapid movement fanned it. It flickered,
blazed, the red flame rushed upward. What
would have happened I dare not think, if just
at that moment a gentleman, who was hastening
down the garden walk, had not caught sight of
the little figure, and, with a horrified exclamation,
seized, held it fast, wrapped round it a great
woollen shawl from his own shoulders, and in
one moment put out the deadly fire which was
snatching at the sweet young life. Who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
this gentleman, do you think, thus arrived at
the very nick of time? Why, no other than
Lady Bird's own Papa, come home from China
a few weeks before any one expected him!</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to describe all that followed
on that bewildering day, the dismay of Grandmamma
and Nursey, the wrath of Jennings
over the match, the joy of everybody at Lady
Bird's escape, or her own confusion of mind at
the fire and the excitement and the new Papa,
who was and was not the Papa of the letters.
At first she hugged the rescued dolls and said
nothing. But Papa gave her time to get used
to him, and she soon did so. He was very
kind and nice, and did not laugh at the children
and call them names as Isabel had done, but
felt Stella's pulse, recommended pomatum for
the scorch on Imogene's forehead, and even
produced a little out of his own dressing-case.
Best of all, he led Lady Bird upstairs, unlocked
a box and showed her a beautiful little Chinese
lady in purple silk and lovely striped muslin
trowsers, which he had brought for her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another child for you to take care of," said
Papa.</p>

<p>Pocahontas Maria wrote in her Diary the
next day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Grandpapa has come home from China.
He is <i>very</i> nice. He brought me a little Chinese
sister. Her name is Loo Choo, he says,
but Mamma calls her Loo Loo, because it sounds
prettier. Grandpapa treats us very kindly, and
never says 'dolls,' as Isabel Berners did; and he
went to call on Lady Green with Mamma. I'm
so glad he is come."</p>

<p>When Lady Bird read this she kissed Pocahontas
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's right, dear; so am I!"</p>

<h2>ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MY SHOE.</h2>


<p>THE old clock on the stairs was drowsy. Its
ticks, now lower, now louder, sounded like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
breathings of one asleep. Now and then came
a distincter tick, which might pass for a little
machine-made snore. As striking-time drew
near, it roused itself with a quiver and shake.
"One, two, three, four, five," it rang in noisy
tones, as who should say, "Behold, I am wide
awake, and have never closed an eye all night."
The sounds sped far. Marianne the cook heard
them, rubbed her eyes, and put one foot out of
bed. The nurse, Louisa, turned over and began
to dream that she was at a wedding. Perhaps
the sun heard too, for he stood up on tip-toe on
the edge of the horizon, looked about him, then
launched a long yellow ray directly at the crack
in the nursery shutter. The ray was sharp: it
smote full on Archie's eyelids, as he lay asleep,
surrounded by "Robinson Crusoe," two red apples,
a piece of gingerbread, and a spade, all of
which he had taken to bed with him. When he
felt the prick of the sun-ray he opened his eyes
wide. "Why, morning's come!" he said, and
without more ado raised himself and sat up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"What'll I do to-day?" he thought. "I
know. I'll go into the wood and build a house,
a nice little house, just like Wobinson Cwusoe's,
all made of sticks, Nobody'll know where my
house is; I'll not tell, not even Mamma, where
it is. Then when I don't want to study or any
thing, I can run away and hide, and they won't
know where to find me. That'll be nice! I
guess I'll go and begin it now, 'cause the days
are getting short. Papa said so once. I wonder
what makes 'em get short? Pr'aps sometime
they'll be so short that there won't be any days
at all, only nights. That wouldn't be pleasant,
I think. Mamma'd have to buy lots of candles
then, or else we couldn't see."</p>

<p>With this he jumped out of bed.</p>

<p>"I must be very quiet," he thought, "else
Loo&mdash;isa'll hear, and then she won't let me go
till I've had my bekfast. Loo&mdash;isa's real cross
sometimes; only sometimes she's kind when
she makes my kite fly."</p>

<p>His clothes were folded on a chair by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
bedside. Archie had never dressed himself
before, but he managed pretty well, except that
he turned the small ruffled shirt wrong-side out.
The other things went on successfully. There
were certain buttons which he could not reach,
but that did not matter. The small stocking
toes were folded neatly in, all ready to slip on to
the feet. But the shoes <i>were</i> a difficulty; they
fastened with morocco bands and buckles, and
Archie couldn't manage them at all.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" he said to himself, "I wish
Loo&mdash;isa would come and buckle my shoes for
me. No, I don't, though, 'cause p'raps she'd
say, 'Go back to bed, naughty boy; it isn't
time to get up.' I wouldn't like that. Sometimes
Loo&mdash;isa does say things to me."</p>

<p>So he put on the shoes without buckling
them, and, not stopping to brush his hair or
wash his face, he clapped on his broad-brimmed
straw hat, took "Robinson Crusoe" and the
spade, dropped the red apples and the gingerbread
into his pocket, and stole softly downstairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
The little feet made no noise as they
passed over the thick carpets. Marianne, who
was lighting the kitchen fire and clattering the
tongs, heard nothing. He reached the front
door, and, stretching up, pulled hard at the bolt.
It was stiff, and would not move.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Archie, "I wish somebody
<i>would</i> come and open this door for me."</p>

<p>He looked at the bolt a minute. Then an
idea struck him, and, laying "Robinson Crusoe"
and the little spade down on the floor, he went
into the dining-room pantry, where was a
drawer with tools in it.</p>

<p>"I'll get Papa's hammer," he thought to himself,
"and I'll pound that old bolt to pieces."</p>

<p>While he was gone, Marianne, who had
lighted her fire, came from the kitchen with a
broom in her hand. She opened the door,
shook the mat, and began to sweep the steps.
A sharp tinkle, tinkle met her ear from the
back gate. It was the milkman ringing for
some one to come and take in the milk. Marianne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
set her broom against the side of the door,
and hurried back to the kitchen. Her foot
struck against "Robinson Crusoe" as she went.
She picked it up and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"Why, the door's open!" exclaimed Archie,
who at that moment came from the dining-room,
hammer in hand.</p>

<p>He did not trouble himself to speculate as
to how the door happened to be open, but,
picking up the spade, wandered forth into the
garden. The gate gave no trouble. He walked
fast, and long before Marianne came back to
her sweeping he had gained the woods, which
were near, and enclosed the house on two sides
in a shady half-circle. They were pretty woods,
full of flowers and squirrels and winding, puzzling
paths. Archie had never been allowed to
go into them alone before.</p>

<p>The morning was delicious, so full of snap
and sunshine that it set him to dancing and
skipping as he went along. All the wood-flowers
were as wide awake as he. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
nodded at Archie, as if saying "Good-morning,"
and sent out fresh smells into the air. Busy
birds flapped and flew, doing their marketing,
and fetching breakfast to hungry nestlings,
chirping and whistling to each other, as they
did so, that the sun was up and it was a fine
day. A pair of striped squirrels frisked and
laughed and called out something saucy as
Archie trotted by. None of these wild things
feared the child: he was too small and too
quick in his movements to be fearful. They
accepted him as one of themselves,&mdash;a featherless
bird, or a squirrel of larger growth; while
he, on his part, smiled vaguely at them and
hurried past, intent on his projects for a house
and careless of every thing else.</p>

<p>The sun rose higher and higher. But the
thick branching trees kept off the heat, and the
wood remained shady and cool. The paths
twisted in and out, and looped into each other
like a tangled riband. No grown person could
have kept a straight course in their mazes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Archie did not even try, but turned to right
or to left just as it happened, taking always
the path which looked prettiest, or which led
into deepest shade. If he saw anywhere a
particularly red checkerberry, he went that
way; otherwise it was all one to him where he
went. So it came to pass that, by the end of
an hour, he was as delightfully and completely
lost as ever little boy has succeeded in being
since woods grew or the world was made.</p>

<p>"I dess this is a nice place for my house,"
he said suddenly, as the path he had been following
led into a small open space, across which
lay a fallen tree, with gray moss, which looked
like hair, hanging to its trunk. It <i>was</i> a nice
place; also, Archie's feet were tired, and he
was growing hungry, which aided in the decision.
The ground about the fallen tree was
carpeted with thick mosses. Some were bright
green, with stems and little branches like tiny,
tiny pine-trees. Others had horn-shaped cups
of yellow and fiery red. Others still were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
bright beautiful brown, while here and there
stood round cushion-shaped masses which looked
as soft as down.</p>

<p>Into the very middle of one of these pretty
green cushions plumped Archie. He rested
his back against a tree trunk, and gave a sigh
of comfort. It was like an easy chair, except
that it had no arms; but what does a little boy
want of arms to chairs? He put his hand into
his pocket and pulled out, first the red apples,
and then the gingerbread. The gingerbread
was rather mashed; but it tasted most delicious,
only there was too little of it.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd brought a hundred more pieces,"
soliloquized Archie, as he nibbled the last
crumb. "One isn't half enough bekfast."</p>

<p>The red apples, however, proved a consolation;
and, quite rested and refreshed now, he
jumped from the moss cushion and prepared to
begin his house-building.</p>

<p>"First, I must pick up some sticks," he
thought,&mdash;"a great many, many sticks, heaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of 'em. Then I'll hammer and make a house.
Only&mdash;I haven't got any nails," he added with
an after-thought.</p>

<p>There were plenty of sticks to be had in that
part of the wood; twigs and branches from the
dead tree, fragments of bark, odds and ends of
dry brush. Close by stood a white birch. The
thin, paper-like covering hung loose on its stem,
like grey-white curls. Archie could pull off
large pieces, and he enjoyed this so much that he
pulled till the birch trunk, as far up as he could
reach, was perfectly bare. Some of the boughs
were crooked. Archie tried to lay them straight
with the others, but they wouldn't fit in nicely,
and stuck their stiff angles out in all directions.</p>

<p>"Those are naughty sticks," said Archie,
giving the crookedest a shove. "They shan't
go into my house at all."</p>

<p>The want of nails became serious as the heap
of wood grew large and Archie was ready to
build. What was the use of a hammer without
nails? He tried various ways. At last he laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the longest boughs in a row against the side of
the fallen tree. This left a little place beneath
their slope into which it was possible to creep.
Archie smiled with satisfaction, and proceeded
to thatch the sloping roof with moss and bits of
bark. Then he grubbed up the green cushion
and transferred it bodily to his house.</p>

<p>"This'll be my chair," he said to himself.
"I dess I don't want any more furnture except
just a chair. Loo&mdash;isa, she said, 'so many
things to dust is a bodder.'"</p>

<p>At that moment came a rustling sound in
the underbrush. "P'raps it's savages," thought
Archie, and, half pleased, half frightened at the
idea, he gave a loud whoop. Out flew a fat
motherly hen, cackling and screaming. What
she was doing there in the woods I cannot
imagine. Perhaps she had lost her way. Perhaps
she had private business there which only
hens can understand. Or it may be that she,
too, had built a little house and hidden it away
so that no one should know where it was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Archie was enchanted. "A hen, a hen," he
cried. "I'll catch her and keep her for my
own. Then I'll have eggs, and I'll give 'em to
Mamma, and I'll make custards. Custards <i>is</i>
made of eggs. Loo&mdash;isa said so."</p>

<p>"Chicky, chicky, chicky," he warbled in a
winning voice, waving his fingers as if he were
sprinkling corn on the ground for the hen to
eat. But the hen was not to be enticed in that
manner, and, screaming louder than ever, ran
into the bushes again. Then Archie began to
run too. Twice he almost seized her brown
wings, but she slipped through his hands. Had
the hen been silent she would easily have
escaped him, but she cackled as she flew, and
that guided him along. His shoe came off,
next the hammer flew out of his hand, but he
did not stop for either. Running, plunging,
diving, on he went, the frightened hen just
before, till at last a root tripped him up and
he fell forward on his face. The hen vanished
into the thicket. Her voice died away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in distance. By the time Archie had picked
himself up there was not even the rustling of a
leaf to show which way she had gone.</p>

<p>He rose from the ground disconsolate. His
nose bled from the fall, and there was a bump
on his forehead, which ached painfully. A
strong desire to cry came over him. But, like
a brave fellow, he would not give way to it, and
sat down under a tree to rest and decide what
was to be done next.</p>

<p>"I'll go back again to my house," was his
decision. But where <i>was</i> the house? He ran
this way, that way; the paths all looked alike.
The house had vanished like the hen. Archie
had not the least idea which way he ought to
turn to find it.</p>

<p>One big tear did force its way to his eyes
when this fact became evident. House and
hen, it was hard to lose both at once. The
hammer, too, was gone. Only the spade remained,
and, armed with this, Archie, like a
true hero, started to find a good place and build<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
another house. Surely nowhere, save in the
histories of the great Boston and Chicago fires,
is record to be found of parallel pluck and determination!</p>

<p>House-building was not half so easy in this
part of the wood where he then was, for the
bushes were thick and stood closely together.
Their branches hung so low, that, small as
Archie was, he had to bend forward and walk
almost double to avoid having his eyes scratched
by them. At last, in the middle of a circle of
junipers, he found a tolerably free space which
he thought would do. The ground, however,
was set thick with sharp uncomfortable stones,
and the first thing needed was to get rid of
them.</p>

<p>So for an hour, with fingers and spade, Archie
dug and delved among the stones. It was hard
work enough, but at last he cleared a place
somewhat larger than his small body, which he
carpeted with soft mosses brought from another
part of the wood. This done, he lay down flat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
on his back, and looked dreamily up at the
pretty green roof made by the juniper boughs
overhead. "I dess I'll take a nappy now," he
murmured, and in five minutes was sleeping as
soundly as a dormouse. Two striped squirrels,
which may or may not have been the same
which he had seen in the early morning, came
out on a bough not a yard from his head, chattered,
winked, put their paws to their noses
and made disrespectful remarks to each other
about the motionless figure. Birds flew and
sang, bees hummed, the wind went to and fro
in the branches like the notes of a low song.
But Archie heard none of these things. The
hen herself might have come back, cackled her
best, and flapped her wings in his very face
without arousing him, so deep was his slumber.</p>

<p>Meantime at home, two miles away, there
was great commotion over the disappearance
of Master Archie. Marianne had lingered quite
a long time at the back gate. The milkman
was a widower, looking out for a wife, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Marianne, as she said, could skim cream with
anybody; so it was only natural that they
should have a great deal to say to each other,
and that measuring the milk at that particular
gate should be a slow business. This morning
their talk was so interesting that twenty minutes
at least went by before Marianne, with
very rosy cheeks and very bright eyes, came
back, pail in hand, along the garden walk. As
she took up the broom to finish her sweeping,
she heard a great commotion overhead, steps
running about, voices exclaiming; but her mind
was full of the milkman, and she paid no attention,
till Louisa came flying downstairs, half-dressed,
and crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sake's alive, Marianne, where's Master Archie?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? Not down here, anyway,"
was Marianne's reply.</p>

<p>"But he <i>must</i> be down here," persisted
Louisa. "He's gone out of the nursery, and so
are his clothes. Whatever's taken him I can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
imagine. I've searched the closets, and looked
under the beds, and up in the attic, and I took
Mr. Gray his hot water, and he isn't there.
His spade's gone too, and his ap&mdash; Oh, mercy!
there's his story-book now," and she pounced on
"Robinson Crusoe," where it lay on the table.
"He's been down here certain sure, for that book
was on his bed when he went to sleep last night.
Don't stand there, Marianne, but come and help
me find him."</p>

<p>Into the parlor, the dining-room, the pantry,
ran the maids, calling "Archie! Archie!" at
the tops of their voices. But Archie, who as we
know was a good mile away by that time, did
not hear them. They searched the kitchen, the
cellar, the wood-shed, the store-closet. Marianne
even lifted the lid of the great copper boiler and
peeped in to make sure that he was not there!
Louisa ran wildly about the garden, looking behind
currant bushes and raspberry vines, and
parting the tall feathers of the asparagus lest
Archie should have chosen to hide among them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
She tapped the great green watermelons with
her fingers as she passed,&mdash;perhaps she fancied
that Archie might be stowed away inside of
one. All was in vain. Archie was not behind
the currant bushes, not even in the melon patch.
Louisa began to sob and cry, Marianne, never
backward, joined her with a true Irish howl;
and it was in this condition that Archie's Papa
found things when he came downstairs to breakfast.</p>

<p>Then ensued a fresh confusion.</p>

<p>"Where did you say the book was lying,
Louisa?" said Mr. Gray, trying to make out
the meaning of her sobbing explanation.</p>

<p>"Just here, sir, on the hall table. Oh, the
darling child, whatever has come to him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, wurra! wurra!" chimed in Marianne.
"He been and got took away by wicked people,
perhaps. Well niver get him back, niver!"</p>

<p>"The hall table? Then he must have passed
out this way. Surely you must have seen him
or heard him open the door, Marianne?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it I see him, sir? I'd niver forget it if I
had. Oh, the pretty face of him! Wurra!
wurra!"</p>

<p>"But, now I think of it, the child couldn't
have opened the door for himself," went on
Papa, growing impatient. "Did you leave it
standing open at all, Marianne?"</p>

<p>"Only for a wee moment while I fetched in
the milk," faltered Marianne, growing rosy-red
as she reflected on the length of the "moment"
which she had passed at the gate with the milkman.</p>

<p>"That must have been the time, then," said
Mr. Gray. "Probably the little fellow has set
off by himself for a walk. I'll go after and look
for him. Don't frighten Mrs. Gray when she
comes down, Louisa, but just say that Archie
and I are both gone out. Try to look as you
usually do."</p>

<p>This, however, was beyond Louisa's powers.
Her eyes were as red as a ferret's, and her cheeks
the color of purple cherries from crying and excitement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of mind. Mrs. Gray saw at once that
something was wrong. She began to question,
Louisa to cry, and the secret came out in a burst
of sobs and tears. "Master Archie&mdash;bless his
little heart!&mdash;has got out of bed and ran away
into the woods. The master was gone after
him, but he'd niver find him at all at all"&mdash;(this
was Marianne's addition). "The tramps
had him fast by this time, no doubt. They'd
niver let him go."</p>

<p>"How could he get away all by himself?"
asked poor frightened Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"Ah, who knows? Like as not the thaves
came into the room and lifted him out of his
very bed. They're iverywhere, thim tramps!
There's no providing against thim. Oh, howly
St. Patrick! who'd have thought it?"</p>

<p>This happy idea of tramps having lodged
itself in Marianne's mind, the story grew rapidly.
The butcher was informed of it when he came,
the fishmonger, and the grocer's boy. By noon
all the village had heard the tale, and farmers'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
wives for ten miles round were shuddering over
these horrible facts, that three men in black
masks, with knives as long as your arm, had
broken into Mr. Gray's house at midnight, gagged
the family, stowed the silver and money in
pillow-cases, token the little boy from his bed,&mdash;that
pretty little boy with curly hair, you know,
my dear,&mdash;and, paying no attention to his
screams and cries, had carried him off nobody
knew where. Poor Mrs. Gray was half dead
with grief, of course, and Mr. Gray had gone in
pursuit; but law! my dear, he'll never catch
'em, and if he did, what could he do against
three men?</p>

<p>"He'd a ought to have taken the constable
with him," said old Mrs. Fidgit, "then perhaps
he'd have got him back. I guess the thieves
won't keep the boy long though, he's too troublesome!
His ma sent him over once on an
errand, and I'd as lieve have a wild-cat in the
house any day. Mark my word, they'll let him
drop pretty soon!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>As the day went on, Louisa began to disbelieve
this theory about robbers. It was Marianne's
theory for one thing; for another, she recollected
that Archie must have taken his apples and
gingerbread with him, and his spade. "Is it
likely that thieves would stop to pack up things
like that?" she asked Marianne, who was highly
indignant at the question. The afternoon came,
still Mr. Gray had not returned, and there were
no tidings of Archie. Mrs. Gray, half ill with
anxiety and headache, went to her room to lie
down. Marianne was describing the exact appearance
of the imaginary robbers to a crony,
who stood outside the kitchen window. "Six
foot high, ivery bit, and a face as black as chimney
sut," Louisa heard her say. "Pshaw," she
called out; but sitting still became unbearable;
and the motion of her needle in and out of the
work made her feel half crazy. She flung down
the work,&mdash;it was a jacket for Archie,&mdash;and,
tying on her bonnet, set off by herself in the
direction of the woods. Where she was going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
she did not know,&mdash;somewhere, anywhere, to
search for her lost boy!</p>

<p>The blind wood paths puzzled Louisa more
than they had puzzled Archie in the morning;
for she wanted to keep her way, which he did
not. She lost it, however, continually. Her
eyes were scratched by boughs and brambles,
the tree roots tripped her up, her dress caught
in a briar and was torn. "Archie! Archie!"
she cried, as she went along. Her voice came
back from the forest in strange echoing tones
which made her start. At last, after winding
and turning for a long time, she found herself
again upon the main path, not far from the
place where she had entered the wood. She
was hot, tired, and breathless; her voice was
hoarse with crying and calling. "I'll wait here
awhile," she thought. "Perhaps the blessed
little dear'll come this way; but, whether he
does or not, I'm too tired to move another step
till I've had some rest." She found a smooth
place under an oak, sat down, and leaned her
back against the stem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cheep, cheep, chickeree," sang one bird
to another. "What a stupid girl that is! I
could tell her which way to go. Why, there's
the mark of his big foot on the moss close by.
Why doesn't she see it and follow? Cheep,
cheep."</p>

<p>"Cluck, cluck, whirr, whillahu," sang the
other bird. "Human beings are <i>too</i> stupid."</p>

<p>Poor stupid Louisa, her eyes blurred with
tears, did not heed the birds' songs or understand
those plain directions for finding Archie
which they were so ready to give. The tree
trunk felt comfortable against her back. The
air came cool and spicy from the wood depths
to steal the smart from her hot face. The
rustle of the leaves was pleasant in her ear.
So the faithful maid waited.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray meantime had tracked Archie for a
little way by the traces of his small feet on the
dewy grass. Then the marks became too confused
to help him longer; he lost the track,
and, after a long and weary walk, found himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on the far side of the wood, near a little village.
There he hired a wagon, and drove home; resolving
to rouse the neighbors, and give the
wood a thorough search, even should it keep
them out all night.</p>

<p>While he was bargaining for his wagon in the
distant village, Archie, in the midst of his nest
of moss, was waking up. He had slept three
hours, and so soundly that, at first arousing, he
could not in the least remember where he was.
He rubbed his eyes, and stared about him wonderingly.
"Why, I'm out in the woods!" he
said in a surprised voice. Gradually he recollected
how he had built the house, chased a
hen, and lost his hammer. This last accident
troubled him a little. "Papa said I mustn't
touch that big hammer ever," he thought to
himself, "'cause I'd be sure to spoil it. But I'll
tell him it isn't spoiled, and he can pick it up
and put it back into the drawer; then he won't
mind."</p>

<p>One of the striped squirrels came down from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a bough overhead, and stopped just in front of
the place where Archie sat. Archie looked at
him; he looked at Archie. The squirrel put
its paws together and rubbed its nose. It
chippered a minute, twinkled its bead-like eyes,
then, with a final flick of its tail, it was off,
and up the tree again like a flash. Archie
looked after it delighted.</p>

<p>"What a pretty bunny!" he said out loud.</p>

<p>"Now I'll go home," was his next remark,
getting suddenly up from the ground.</p>

<p>The cause of this resolution was a little gnawing
sensation which had begun within him and
was getting stronger every moment. In other
words, he was hungry. Gingerbread and apples
do not satisfy little boys as roast beef does.
Archie's stomach was quite empty, and began
to cry with an unmistakable voice, "I want my
dinner, I want my dinner. Give me my dinner
quick, or I shall do something desperate."
Everybody in the world has to listen when
voices like these begin to sound inside of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
All at once home seemed the most attractive
spot in the world to Archie. Visions of Mamma
and bread and milk and a great plate full of
something hot arose before his eyes, and an
immense longing for these delights took possession
of him. So he shouldered his spade and
set forth, not having the least notion&mdash;poor
little soul!&mdash;as to which side home lay, but
believing, with the confidence of childhood, that
now he wanted to go that way, the way was
sure to be easily found. Refreshed by his long
sleep, he marched sturdily on, taking any path
which struck his eye first.</p>

<p>There is a pretty picture&mdash;I wonder if any
of you have ever seen it?&mdash;in which a little
child is seen walking across a narrow plank
which bridges a deep chasm, while behind flies
a tall, beautiful angel, with a hand on either
side the child, guiding it along. The child does
not see the angel, and walks fearlessly; but the
heavenly hands are there, and the little one is
safe. It may be that just such a good angel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
flew behind our little Archie that afternoon to
guide him through the mazes of the wood.
Certain it is that, without knowing it, he turned,
or something turned him, in the direction of
home. It was far for such small feet to go, and
he made the distance farther by straying, now
to left and now to right; but, after each of
these strayings, the unseen hands brought him
back again to the right path and led him on.
He did not stop to play now, for the hungry
voices grew louder each minute, and he was in
a hurry to get home. Speculations as to whether
dinner would be all eaten up crossed his mind.
"But I dess not," he said confidently, "'cause
it isn't very long since morning." It was really
four in the afternoon, but Archie's long nap
had cheated the time, and he had no idea that
it was so late.</p>

<p>The path grew wider, and was hedged with
barberries and wild roses. The lovely pink of
the roses pleased Archie's eye. He stopped
and tugged at a great branch till it broke, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
he laid it across his shoulder to carry to Mamma.
Suddenly, as he tramped along, a gasp and
exclamation was heard, and a tall figure rose up
from under a tree and caught him in its arms.
It was Louisa, who had fallen half asleep at her
post, and had been roused by the sound of the
well-known little feet as they went by.</p>

<p>"Master Archie, dear," she cried, sobbing,
"how could you run away and scare us so?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's Loo&mdash;isa," said Archie wonderingly.
"Did you come out here to build a
house too, Loo&mdash;isa?"</p>

<p>"Where <i>have</i> you been?" clamored Louisa,
holding him tight in her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, out there," explained Archie, waving
his hand toward the woods generally.</p>

<p>"How could you slip away and frighten
Nursey so, and poor Mamma and Papa? Papa's
been all the day hunting you. And where are
you going now?"</p>

<p>"Home! Stop a squeezing of me, Loo&mdash;isa.
I don't like to be squeezed. Has the dinner-bell
runged yet? I want my dinner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dinner! Why it's most evening, Master
Archie. And nobody could eat, because we
was so frightened at your being lost."</p>

<p>"I wasn't lost!" cried Archie indignantly.
"I was building a house. Come along, Loo&mdash;isa,
I'll show you the way."</p>

<p>So Archie took Louisa's hand and led her
along. Neither of them knew the path, but
they were in the right direction, and by and
by the trees grew thinner, and they could see
where they were, on the edge of Mr. Plimpton's
garden, not far from home.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gray were consulting together
on the piazza, when the click of the gate made
them look up, and behold! the joyful Louisa,
displaying Archie, who walked by her side.</p>

<p>"Here he is, ma'am," she cried. "I found
him way off in the wood. He'd run away."</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Archie, squirming out of his
mother's arms. "I was building houses. And
you didn't find me a bit, Loo&mdash;isa. I found
you, and I showed you the way home!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind who found who, so long as we
have our little runaway back," said Mr. Gray,
stooping to kiss Archie. "Another time we
must have a talk about boys who go to build
houses without leave from their Mamma's and
Papa's, and make everybody anxious. Meantime,
I fancy somebody I know about is half-starved.
Tell Marianne to send some dinner in
at once, Louisa."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I will." And Louisa hastened off
to triumph over her friend Marianne.</p>

<p>"Archie, darling, how could you go away and
frighten us so?" asked Mrs. Gray, taking him
in her lap.</p>

<p>"Why, Mamma, were you frightened?" replied
Archie wonderingly. "I was building a
house. It's a <i>beau</i>-tiful house. I'll let you
come and sit in it if you want to. And I've
got a hen, and I'll give you all the eggs she
lays, to cook, you know. Only the hen's runned
away, and I couldn't find my house any more,
and the hammer tumbled down, and I lost my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
shoe. I know where the hammer is, I dess, and
to-morrow I'll go back and get it."&mdash;Here the
expression of Archie's face changed. Louisa
had appeared at the door with a plate of something
which smelt excessively nice, and sent a
little curl of steam into the air. She beckoned.
He jumped down from Mamma's lap, ran to the
door, and both disappeared. Nothing more was
heard of him except his feet on the stairs, and
by and by the sound of Louisa's rocking-chair,
as she sat beside his bed singing Archie to sleep.
Mamma and Papa went in together a little later
and stood over their boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, the comfort of seeing him safe in his
little bed to-night!" said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>Roused by her voice, Archie stirred. "I <i>dess</i>
I know where the hammer is," he said drowsily.
Then his half-opened eyes closed, and he was
sound asleep.</p>

<h2>RIDE A COCK-HORSE.</h2>


<p>IT was a drizzly day in the old market-town of
Banbury. The clouds hung low: all the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
was wrapped in sulky mist. When the sun
tried to shine out, as once or twice he did, his
face looked like a dull yellow spot against the
sky, and the clouds hurried up at once and extinguished
him. Children tapped on window
panes, repeating&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rain, rain, go away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come again some other day."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But the rain would not take the hint, and after
awhile the sun gave up his attempts, hid his
head, and went away disgusted, to shine somewhere
else.</div>

<p>"It's too bad, it's <i>too</i> bad!" cried Alice Flower,
the Mayor's little daughter, looking as much out
of sorts as the weather itself.</p>

<p>"You mustn't say too bad. It is God who
makes it rain or shine, and He is always right,"
remarked her Aunt.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know," replied Alice in a timid
voice. "But, Aunty, I did want to go to the
picnic very much."</p>

<p>"So did I. We are both disappointed," said
Aunty, smiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'm the <i>most</i> disappointed," persisted
Alice, "because you're grown up, you know, and
I haven't any thing pleasant to do. All my
doll's spring clothes are made, and I've read my
story-books till I'm tired of 'em, and I learned
my lessons for to-morrow with Miss Boyd yesterday,
because we were going to the picnic. Oh,
dear, what a long morning this has been! It
feels like a week."</p>

<p>Just then, Toot! toot! toot! sounded from
the street below. Alice hurried back to the
window. She pressed her nose close to the
glass, but at first could see nothing; then, as
the sound grew nearer, a man on horseback
rode into view. He was gorgeously dressed in
black velveteen, with orange sleeves and an
orange lining to his cloak. He carried a brass
trumpet, which every now and then he lifted to
his lips, blowing a long blast. This was the
sound which Alice had heard.</p>

<p>Following the man came a magnificent scarlet
chariot, drawn by ten black horses with scarlet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
trappings and scarlet feathers in their heads.
Each horse was ridden by a little page in a
costume of emerald green. The chariot was
full of musicians in red uniforms. They held
umbrellas over their instruments, and looked
sulky because of the rain, which was no wonder.
Still, the effect of the whole was gay and dazzling.
Behind the chariot came a long procession of
horses, black, gray, sorrel, chestnut, or marked
in odd patches of brown and white. These
horses were ridden by ladies in wonderful blue
and silver and pink and gold habits, and by
knights in armor, all of whom carried umbrellas
also. Pages walked beside the horses, waving
banners and shields with "Visit Currie's World-Renowned
Circus" painted on them. A droll
little clown, mounted on an enormous bay horse,
made fun of the pages, imitated their gestures,
and rapped them on the back with his riding-stick
in a droll way. A long line of blue and
red wagons closed the cavalcade.</p>

<p>But prettiest of all was a little girl about ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
years old, who rode in the middle of the procession
upon a lovely horse as white as milk. The
horse had not a single spot of dark color about
him, and his trappings of pale blue were so
slight that they seemed like ribbons hung on
his graceful limbs. The little girl had hair of
bright, pale yellow, which fell to her waist in
loose shining waves. She was small and slender,
but her color was like roses, and her blue eyes
and sweet pink mouth smiled every moment as
she bent and swayed to the motion of the horse,
which she managed beautifully, though her bits
of hands seemed almost too small to grasp the
reins. Her riding-dress of blue was belted and
buttoned with silver; a tiny blue cap with long
blue plumes was on her head; and altogether
she seemed to Alice like a fairy princess, or one
of those girls in story-books who turn out to be
kings' daughters or something else remarkable.</p>

<p>"O Aunty! come here do come," cried Alice.</p>

<p>Just then the procession halted directly beneath
the window. The trumpeter took off his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hat and made a low bow to Alice and her Aunt.
Then he blew a final blast, rose in his stirrups
and began to speak. Miss Flower opened the
window that they might hear more distinctly.
This seemed to bring the pretty little girl on
the horse nearer. She looked up at Alice and
smiled, and Alice smiled back at her.</p>

<p>This is what the trumpeter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen,&mdash;I have the honor
to announce to you the arrival in Banbury of
Signor James Currie's World-Renowned Circus
and Grand Unrivalled Troupe of Equestrian
Performers, whose feats of equitation and horsemanship
have given unfeigned delight to all
the courts of Europe, her Majesty the Queen,
and the nobility and gentry of this and other
countries. Among the principal attractions of
this unrivalled troupe are Mr. Vernon Twomley,
with his famous trained steed Bucephalus;
Madame Orley, with her horse Chimborazo, who
lacks only the gift of speech to take a first class
at the University of Oxford; M. Aristide, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
admired trapezeist; Goo-Goo, the unparalleled
and side-splitting clown; and last, but not least,
Mademoiselle Mignon, the child equestrienne,
whose feats of agility are the wonder of the
age! On account of Mr. Currie's unprecedented
press of engagements, his appearance
in Banbury is limited to a single performance,
which will take place this evening under the
Company's magnificent tent, in the Market Place,
behind the old cross. Come one, come all!
Performances to begin at eight precisely. Admission,
one-and-sixpence. Children under ten
years of age, half price. God save the Queen."</p>

<p>Having finished this oration, the trumpeter
bowed once more to the window, blew another
blast, and rode on, followed by all the procession;
the little girl on the white horse giving
Alice a second smile as she moved away. For
awhile the toot, toot, toot of the trumpet could
be heard from down the street. Then the
sounds grew fainter. At last they died in distance,
and all was quiet as it had been before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice was sorry to have them go. But the
interruption had done her good by taking her
thoughts away from the rain and the lost picnic.
She could think and talk of nothing now except
the gay riders, and especially the pretty little
girl on the white horse.</p>

<p>"Wasn't she sweet?" she asked her Aunt.
"And didn't she ride <i>beau</i>tifully. I wish I
could ride like that. And what a pretty name,
Mademoiselle Mignon! It must be very nice to
belong to a circus, I think."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that Mademoiselle Mignon does
not always find it so nice," remarked Miss
Flower.</p>

<p>"O Aunty, what makes you say so? She
looks as if she were perfectly happy! Didn't
you see her laugh when the clown stole the
other man's cap from his head? And such a
dear horse as she was riding! I never saw such
a dear horse in all my life. I wish I had one
just like him."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a beauty. So perfectly white."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wasn't it! O Aunty, don't you wish
Papa would take you and me to the performance?
There will only be one, you know,
because Mr. Currie has such un&mdash;un&mdash;unpresidential
engagements. I mean to ask Papa
if he won't. There he is now! I hear his key
in the door. May I run down and ask him,
Aunty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Downstairs ran Alice.</p>

<p>"O Papa!" she cried, "<i>did</i> you meet the
Circus? It was the most wonderful Circus, Papa.
Just like a story-book. And such a dear little
girl on a white horse! Won't you please take
me to see it, Papa&mdash;and Aunty too? We both
want to go very much. It's only here for one
night, the man said."</p>

<p>"We'll see," said the Mayor, taking off his
coat. Alice danced with pleasure when she
heard this "we'll see," for with Papa "we'll
see" meant almost always the same thing as
"yes." Alice was an only child, and a petted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
one, and Papa rarely refused any request on
which his motherless little girl had set her heart.</p>

<p>She skipped upstairs beside him, full of satisfaction,
and had just settled herself on his knee
for the half hour of frolic and talk which was
her daily delight and his, when a knock came
to the door below, and Phebe the maid appeared.</p>

<p>"Two persons to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Show them in here," said the Mayor. Alice
lingered and was rewarded, for the "persons"
were no other than Signor Currie himself and
his ring-master. Alice recognized them at once.
Both were gorgeously dressed in black and
orange and velvet-slashed sleeves, and came in
holding their plumed hats in their hands. The
object of the call was to solicit the honor of the
Mayor's patronage for the evening's entertainment.
How pleased Alice was when Papa engaged
a box and paid for it!</p>

<p>"I shall bring my little daughter here," he
told Signor Currie. "She is much taken by a
child whom she saw to-day among your performers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Mignon, no doubt," replied
the Signor solemnly. "She is, indeed, a prodigy
of talent,&mdash;one of the wonders of the age,
I assure your worship!"</p>

<p>"Well," said his worship, smiling, "we shall
see to-night. Good-day to you."</p>

<p>"O Papa, that is delightful!" cried Alice, the
moment the men were gone. "How I wish it
were evening already! I can scarcely wait."</p>

<p>Evenings come at last, even when waited
for. Alice had not time, after all, to get
<i>very</i> impatient before the carriage was at the
door, and she and Papa and Aunty were in it,
rolling away toward the market-place. Crowds
of people were going in the same direction.
Half the Papas and Mammas in Banbury had
taken their boys and girls to see the show.
There, behind the market cross, rose the great
tent, a flapping red flag on top. Bright lights
streamed from within. How exciting it was!
The tent was so big inside that there was plenty
of room for all the people who wished to come,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and more. Ranges of benches ran up till they
met the canvas roof. Below were the boxes,
hung with red and white cloth and banners.
Dazzling lights were everywhere, the band was
playing, from behind the green curtain came
sounds of voices and horses whinnying to each
other. Alice had never been to a circus before.
It seemed to her the most beautiful and bewildering
place which she had ever imagined.</p>

<p>By and by the performance began. How
the Banbury children did enjoy it! The clown's
little jokes had done duty in hundreds of places
before. Some of them had even appeared in
the almanac! But in Banbury they were all
new, and so funny that everybody laughed till
their sides ached. And the wonderful horses!
Madame Orley's educated steed, which picked
out letters from a card alphabet and spelled
words with them, went through the military
drill with the precision of a trooper, and waltzed
about the arena with his mistress on his back!&mdash;well,
he was not a horse; he was a wizard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
steed, like the one described in the "Arabian
Nights Tales." Alice almost thought she detected
the little peg behind his ear!</p>

<p>She shuddered over the feats of the sky-blue
trapezeist, who seemed to do every thing but
fly. The knights in imitation armor were real
knights to Alice; the pink and gold ladies were
veritable damsels of romance, undergoing adventures.
But, delightful as all this was, she
was conscious that the best remained behind,
and eagerly watched the door of entrance, in
hopes of the appearance of the white steed and
the little rider who had so fascinated her imagination
in the morning. Papa noticed it, and
laughed at her; but, for all that, she watched.</p>

<p>At last they came, and Alice was satisfied.
Mignon looked prettier and daintier than ever
in her light fantastic robe of white and spangles,
with silver bracelets on her wrists and little
anklets hung with bells about her slender ankles.
Round and round and round galloped
the white horse, the fairy figure on his back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
now standing, now lying, now on her knees,
now poised on one small foot, or, again, dancing
to the music on top of the broad saddle, keeping
exact time, every movement graceful and light
as that of a happy elf. Hoops, wreathed with
roses and covered with silver paper, were raised
across her path. She bounded through them
easily, smiling as she sprang. The white horse
seemed to love her, and to obey her every
gesture; and Mignon evidently loved the horse,
for more than once in the pauses Alice saw
her pat and caress the pretty creature. At
length the final bound was taken, the last
rose-wreathed hoop was carried away, Mignon
kissed her hand to the audience and disappeared
at full gallop, the curtain fell, and the ring-master
announced that Part First was ended,
and that there would be an intermission of
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>By this time Alice was in a state of tumultuous
admiration which knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could only speak to her and kiss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
her, just once!" she cried. "Isn't she the darlingest
little thing you ever saw? I wish I
could. Don't you think they'd let me, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Would there be any harm in it, do you
think?" asked the Mayor of his sister. "She's
a pretty, innocent-looking little creature."</p>

<p>"I don't quite like having Alice associate
with such people," objected Miss Flower. Then,
softened by the wistful eagerness of Alice's
face, she added, "Still, in this case, the child is
so young that I really think there would be no
harm, except that the manager might object
to having the little girl disturbed between the
acts."</p>

<p>"I'll inquire," said Papa.</p>

<p>The manager was most obliging. Managers
generally are, I fancy, when Mayors
express wishes. "Mademoiselle Mignon," he
said, "would be very pleased and proud to
receive Miss Flower, if she would take the
trouble to come behind the scenes." So Alice,
trembling with excitement, went with Papa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
behind the big green curtain. She had fancied
it a sort of fairy world; but instead she found
a great bare, disorderly place. Sawdust was
scattered on the ground; huge boxes were
standing about, some empty, some half unpacked.
From farther away came sounds of
loud voices talking and disputing, and the stamping
of horses' feet. It was neither a pretty or
a pleasant place; and Alice, feeling shy and half
frightened, held Papa's hand tight, and squeezed
it very hard as they waited.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the manager came to them with
Mignon beside him. She looked smaller and
more childish than she had done on horseback.
A little plaid shawl was pinned over her gauzy
dress to keep her warm. Alice lost her fears
at once. She realized that here was no fairy
princess, but a little girl like herself. Mignon's
face was no less sweet when seen so near. Her
cheeks were the loveliest pink imaginable.
Her blue eyes looked up frankly and trustfully.
When the Mayor spoke to her she blushed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
made a pretty courtesy, clasping Alice's hand
very tight in hers, but saying nothing.</p>

<p>"The performances will recommence in ten
minutes," said Signor Currie, consulting his
watch. Then he and the Mayor moved a little
aside and began talking together, leaving the
little girls to make acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I saw you this morning," said Alice.</p>

<p>Mignon nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you see me? I thought you did,
but I wasn't sure, because we were up so high.
Aunty and I thought the procession was beautiful.
But I liked your horse best of all. Is he
gentle?"</p>

<p>"Pluto? oh, he's very gentle," replied Mignon.
"Only now and then he gets a little wild
when the people hurrah and clap very loud.
But he always knows me."</p>

<p>"How beautifully you do ride," went on
Alice. "It looks just like flying when you
jump through the hoops. I wish I knew how.
Is it very hard to do?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;except when I get tired. Then I
don't do it well. But as long as the music
plays I don't feel tired. Sometimes before I
come out I am frightened, and think I can't do
it at all, but then I hear the band begin, and I
know I can. Oh! don't you love music?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es," said Alice wonderingly, for Mignon's
eyes sparkled and her face flushed as she
asked this question. "I like music when it's
pretty."</p>

<p>"I love it so <i>so</i> much," went on Mignon confidentially.
"It's like flowers&mdash;and colors&mdash;all
sorts of things&mdash;sunsets too. Our band
plays beautifully, don't you think so? It makes
me feel as if I could do any thing in the world,
fly or dance on the air,&mdash;any thing! It's quite
different when they stop. Then I don't want
to jump or spring, but just to sit still. If they
would keep on playing always, I don't believe I
should ever get tired."</p>

<p>"How funny!" said the practical Alice. "I
never feel that way at all. Aunty says I haven't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
got a bit of ear for music. Did you see Aunty
at the window this morning when you looked
up?"</p>

<p>"Was that your Aunty? I thought it was
your Mamma."</p>

<p>"No; I haven't got any Mamma. She died
when I was a little baby. I don't remember
her a bit."</p>

<p>"Neither do I mine," said Mignon wistfully.
"Mr. Currie says he guesses I never had any.
Do you think I could? Little girls always have
Mammas, don't they?"</p>

<p>"But haven't you an Aunty or any thing?"
cried Alice.</p>

<p>Mignon shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "No Aunty."</p>

<p>"Why! Who takes care of you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they all take care of me," replied Mignon
smiling. "Madame Orley,&mdash;that's Mrs.
Currie, you know,&mdash;she's very kind. She curls
my hair and fastens my frock in the morning,
and she always dresses me for the performance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
herself. Mr. Currie,&mdash;he's kind too. He gave
me these anklets and my silver bracelets and
two rings&mdash;see&mdash;one with a blue stone and
one with a red stone. Aren't they pretty? Goo-Goo
is nice too. He taught me to write last
year. And old Jerry,&mdash;that's the head groom,
you know,&mdash;he's the kindest of all. He says
I'm like his little granddaughter that died, and
wherever we go he almost always buys me a
present. Look what he gave me this morning,"
putting her hand into the bosom of her frock
and pulling out an ivory needle-case. "I keep
it here for fear it'll get lost. There's always
such a confusion when we only stop one night
in a place."</p>

<p>"Isn't it pretty," said Alice admiringly. "I'm
glad Jerry gave it to you. But I wish you had
an Aunty, because mine is so nice."</p>

<p>"Or a Mamma," said Mignon thoughtfully.
"If I only had a Mamma of my own, and music
which would play <i>all the time</i> and never stop,
I should be just happy. I wouldn't mind the
Enchanted Steed then,&mdash;or any thing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the Enchanted Steed?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh,&mdash;one of the things I do. It's harder
than the rest, so I don't like it quite so well.
You'll see&mdash;it's the grand <i>finale</i> to-night."</p>

<p>A sharp little bell tinkled.</p>

<p>"That's to ring up the curtain," said Mignon.
"I must go. Thank you so much for coming to
see me."</p>

<p>"Oh, wait one minute!" cried Alice, diving
into her pocket. "Yes, I thought so. Here's
my silver thimble. Won't you take it for a
keepsake, dear, to go with your needle-book,
you know? And don't forget me, because I
never, never shall forget you. My name's
Alice,&mdash;Alice Flower."</p>

<p>"How pretty!" cried Mignon, looking admiringly
at the thimble. "How kind you are!
Good-by."</p>

<p>"Kiss your hand to me from the back of the
horse, won't you, please?" said Alice. "That
will be splendid! Good-by, dear, good-by."</p>

<p>The two children kissed each other; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Mignon ran away, tucking the thimble into her
bosom as she went.</p>

<p>"O Aunty! you never saw such a darling
little thing as she is!" cried Alice, when they
had got back to the box. "So sweet, and so
pretty, prettier than any of the little girls we
know, Aunty. I'm sure you'd think so if you
saw her near. She hasn't any Mamma either,
and no Aunty or any thing. She wishes so
much she had. But she says all the circus
people are real kind to her. You can't think
how much she loves music. If the band would
play all the time, she could fly, she says, or do
any thing else that was hard. It was so queer
to hear her talk about it. I never saw any little
girl that I liked so much. I wish she was my
sister, my own true sister; really I do, Aunty."</p>

<p>"Why, Alice, I never knew you so excited
about anybody before," remarked Miss Flower.</p>

<p>"O Aunty! she isn't <i>anybody</i>; she's quite
different from common people. How I wish
she'd hurry and come out again. She promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to kiss her hand to me from the horse's back,
Papa. Won't that be splendid?"</p>

<p>The whole performance was more interesting
to Alice since her conversation with Mignon.
Madame Orley and her trained steed were quite
new and different now that she knew that
Madame Orley's real name was Currie, and that
she curled Mignon's hair every morning. Goo-Goo
seemed like an intimate friend, because of
the writing-lessons. Alice was even sure that
she could make out old Jerry of the needle-book
among the attendants. Round and round and
round sped the horses. Goo-Goo cracked his
whip. The trapezeist swung high in air like
a glittering blue spider suspended by silver
threads. Mr. Vernon Twomley's Bucephalus
did every thing but talk. Somebody else on
another horse played the violin and stood on his
head meanwhile, all at full gallop! It was delightful.
But the best of all was when Mignon
came out again. Her cheeks were rosier, her
eyes brighter than ever, and&mdash;yes&mdash;she recollected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
her promise, for during the very first
round she turned to Alice, poised on one foot
like a true fairy, smiled charmingly, and kissed
her hand twice. How delightful that was! Not
Alice only, but all the children present were
bewitched by Mignon that evening. Twenty
little girls at least said to their mothers, "Oh,
how I would like to ride like that!" and many
who did not speak wished privately that they
could change places and <i>be</i> Mignon. Alice did
not wish this any longer. The noise and confusion
behind the scenes, the stamping horses
and swearing men, had given her a new idea of
the life which poor Mignon had to lead among
these sights and sounds, the only child among
many grown people, dependant upon the chance
kindness of clowns and head grooms for her
few pleasures, her little education. She no
longer desired to change places. What she
now wanted was to carry Mignon away for
a companion and friend, sharing lessons with
her and Aunty and all the other good things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
which she had forgotten, when in the morning
she wished herself a part of the gay circus
troupe.</p>

<p>And now the performances were almost over.
One last feat remained, the <i>Finale</i>, of which
Mignon had spoken. It stood on the bills
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">"GRAND FINALE!!<br />

IN CONCLUSION<br />

WILL BE GIVEN THE STUPEFYING FEAT<br />

OF<br />

THE ENCHANTED STEED,<br />

AND<br />

THE FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR!<br />

<i>Performers:</i><br />

MADEMOISELLE MIGNON; HER HORSE PLUTO; M. ARISTIDE;
AND M. JOACHIN."<br /></div>

<p>Alice watched with much interest the arrangements
making for this feat. Fresh sawdust was
sprinkled over the arena, the ropes of the trapezes
were lowered and tested: evidently the
feat was a difficult one, and needed careful
preparation. M. Aristide and M. Joachin took
their places on the suspended bars, the ring-master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
cleared the circle, and Mignon rode in at
a gallop. Three times she went round the arena
at full speed, then she was snatched from the
horse's back by the long arm of M. Aristide extended
from the trapeze above. Pluto galloped
steadily on. One second only M. Aristide held
Mignon poised in air, then he flung her lightly
across the space to M. Joachin, who as lightly
caught her, waited a second, and, as Pluto passed
beneath, dropped her upon his back. It looked
fearfully dangerous; all depended upon the
exact time at which each movement was executed.
The whole audience caught its breath,
but Mignon did not seem to be frightened. Her
little face was quite unruffled as the strong men
tossed her to and fro, her limbs and dress fell
into graceful lines as she went through the air;
it was really like a bird's flight. Alice's hands
were squeezed tightly together, she could hardly
breathe. Ah!&mdash;Pluto was an instant too late,
or M. Joachin a second too soon,&mdash;which was
it? Mignon missed the saddle,&mdash;grazed it with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
her foot, fell,&mdash;striking one of the wooden supports
of the tent with her head as she touched
the ground. There was a universal thrill and
shudder. Mr. Currie hurried up, Pluto faltered
in his pace, whinnied and ran back to where his
little mistress lay. But in one moment Mignon
was on her feet again, making her graceful
courtesy and kissing her hand, though she
looked very pale. The curtain fell rapidly.
Alice, looking anxiously that way, had a vague
idea that she saw Mignon drop down again, but
Aunty said, "How fortunate that that sweet
little thing was not hurt;" and Alice, being
used to finding Aunty always in the right, felt
her heart lightened. They went out, following
the audience, who were all praising Mignon, and
saying that it might have been a terrible accident;
and, for their part, it didn't seem right to
let children run such risks, and they were thankful
that the little dear was not injured. Many a
child envied Mignon that night; many dreamed
of silver spangles, galloping steeds, roses, applause,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and waked up thinking how charming it
must be to live on a horse's back with music
always playing, and exciting things going on,
and people praising you!</p>

<p>Oh, dear! I wish I could stop here. Why
should there be painful things in the world
which must be written about? That pretty
courtesy, that spring from the earth were poor
Mignon's last. She had risen and bowed with
the instinct which all players feel to act out
their parts to the end, but as the curtain fell
down she dropped again, this time heavily.
Mr. Currie, much frightened, lifted and carried
her to his wife's tent. The band, who were
playing out the audience, stopped with a dismayed
suddenness. Goo-Goo untied his mask
and hurried in. Madame Orley, who was feeding
Chimborazo with sugar, dropped the sugar
on the floor and ran too. Jerry flew for a
doctor. Mignon was laid on a bed. They
fanned her, rubbed her feet, put brandy into
her pale lips. But it was all of no use. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
little hands were cold, the blue-veined eyelids
would not unclose. Madame Orley and the
other women riders who were clustered beside
the bed began to sob bitterly. They all loved
Mignon; she was the pet and baby of the whole
circus troupe.</p>

<p>It was not long before the doctor came. He
felt Mignon's pulse, and tried various things,
but his face was very grave.</p>

<p>"She's a frail little creature," he said. "No
stamina to carry her through."</p>

<p>"She's opening her eyes," cried Madame
Orley. "She's coming to herself."</p>

<p>Slowly the blue eyes opened. At first she
seemed not to see the anxious countenances
bent over her. Then a look of recognition crept
into her face, and a wan little smile parted the
lips. She lifted one hand and began to fumble
feebly in the bosom of her frock.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mignon, dear?" said one of the
women. It was Alice's silver thimble that Mignon
was seeking after. When it was given her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
she seemed content, and lay clasping it in her
hand.</p>

<p>Just then a strange noise came from outside.
Pluto, suspecting that something had gone
wrong, had slipped his halter. A groom tried
to catch him. He snorted back and cantered
away. At the door of Madame Orley's tent he
paused, put in his head and gave a long whinny.</p>

<p>Mignon started. The bells on her ankles
tinkled a little as she moved.</p>

<p>"Now, Pluto"&mdash;she whispered faintly,&mdash;"steady,
dear Pluto. Ah, there's the music at
last! I thought it would never begin. How
sweet,&mdash;oh, how sweet! They never made such
sweet music before. I can do it now." A smile
brightened her face.</p>

<p>"Has she a mother?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>The words caught Mignon's ear. She looked
up. "Mamma," she said&mdash;"Mamma! Did <i>you</i>
make the music?" Her head fell back, she
closed her eyes.&mdash;That was all.</p>

<p>"She loved music so dearly," said one of the
women weeping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has it now," replied the good old doctor,
laying down the little hand from which the pulse
had ebbed away. "Don't cry so over her, my
good girl. She was a tender flower for such a
life as this. Depend upon it, it is better as it is.
Heaven is a home-like place for such little ones
as she, and the angels' singing will be sweeter to
her ears than the music of your brass band."</p>

<h2>LADY QUEEN ANNE.</h2>


<p>"WHERE is Annie?" demanded old Mrs. Pickens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. Not far away, for
I heard her voice just now singing in the woods
near the house."</p>

<p>"That child is always singing, always," went
on Mrs. Pickens in a melancholy voice. "What
she finds to sing about in this miserable place I
cannot imagine. It's really unnatural!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! mother,&mdash;not unnatural. Remember
what a child she is. She hardly
remembers the old life, or misses it. The sun
shines, and she sings,&mdash;she can't help it. We
ought to be glad instead of sorry that she
doesn't feel the changes as we do."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>am</i> glad," responded the old lady.
"You needn't take me up so sharply, Susan.
All I say is that it seems to me <i>unreasonable</i>."</p>

<p>Miss Pickens glanced about the room, and
suppressed a sigh. It was, indeed, a miserable
dwelling, scarcely better than a hut. Very few
of you who read this have ever seen a place so
comfortless or so poor. The roof let in rain.
Through the cracked, uneven floor the ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
could be distinctly seen. A broken window-pane
was stopped by an old hat thrust into the
hole. For furniture was only a rusty stove, a
table, three chairs, a few battered utensils for
cooking, and a bed laid on the floor of the inner
room,&mdash;that was all. And the dwellers in this
wretched home, for which they were indebted to
the charity of friends scarcely richer than themselves,
were ladies born and bred, accustomed
to all the comforts and enjoyments of life.</p>

<p>It was the old story,&mdash;alas! too common in
these times,&mdash;the story of a Southern family
reduced to poverty by the ravages of war.
Six years before, all had been different. Then
the fighting was not begun, and the Southern
Confederacy was a thing to boast over and
make speeches about. The gray uniforms were
smart and new then; the volunteers eager
and full of zeal. All things went smoothly in
the stately old house known to Charleston
people as the "Pickens Mansion." The cotton
was regularly harvested on the Sea Islands, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
on the Beaufort plantation, which belonged to
Annie; for little Annie, too, was an heiress,
with acres and negroes of her own. War
seemed an easy thing in those days, and a glorious
one. There was no lack felt anywhere;
only a set of fresh and exciting interests in
lives which had always been interesting enough.
Mrs. Pickens and the other Charleston ladies
scraped lint and rolled bandages with busy
fingers; but they smiled at each other as they
did so, and said that these would never be
needed, there would never be any real fighting!
They stood on their balconies to cheer and
applaud the incoming regiments,&mdash;regiments
of gallant young men, their own sons and the
sons of neighbors: and it was like the opening
chapter of a story. Ah! the story had run
through many chapters since then, and what
different ones! The smart uniforms had lost
all their gloss, blood was upon the flags, the
glory had changed to ashes; every family wore
mourning for somebody. The pleasant Charleston<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
home, where Mrs. Pickens had stood on the
balcony to watch the gray-coated troops pass
by, and little Annie had fluttered her mite of a
handkerchief, and laughed as the gay banners
danced in air, where was it? Burned to the
ground; only a sorry heap of ruin marked
where once it stood. No more cotton bales
came from the Sea Islands. First one army,
then the other, had swept over the Beaufort
plantation, trampling its fields into mire. It
had been seized, confiscated, retaken, re-confiscated,
sold to this person and that. Nobody
knew exactly to whom it belonged nowadays;
but it was not to little Annie, rightful heiress
of all. Stripped of every thing, reduced to
utter want, Mrs. Pickens and her daughter took
refuge in a lonely village, far up among the
Carolina hills, where some former friends, also
ruined by the war, offered them the wretched
home where now we find them. Little Annie,
sole blossom left upon the blasted tree, went
with them. It was a miserable life which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
led. The pinch of poverty is never so keenly
felt as when the recollection of better days
mixes with it like a perpetual sting. All the
bright hopes of six years before were over, and
the poor ladies could have said, "Behold, was
ever sorrow like unto my sorrow!" They
grieved for themselves; they grieved most of
all for their beautiful little Annie, but Annie
did not grieve,&mdash;not she!</p>

<p>Never was a happier little maiden,&mdash;as
blithe and merry in her coarse cotton frock and
bare feet as though the cotton were choicest
satin. She was as pretty too. No frock could
spoil that charming little face framed in thick
chestnut curls, or hide the graceful movements
which would have made her remarkable anywhere.
Her eyes, which were brown like her
curls, danced continually. Her mouth was
always smiling. The dimples came and went
with every word she spoke. And, however
shabby might be her dress, she was a little lady
always. No one could mistake it, who listened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to her sweet voice and prettily chosen words.
The pitiful sadness of her Grandmother, the
rigid melancholy of her Aunt, passed over her
as a cloud drifts over a blue sky on a summer's
day, leaving the blue undimmed. She
loved them, and was sorry when they were
sorry; but God had given her such a happy
nature, that happy she must be in spite of
all. Just to be alive was pleasant enough, but
there were many other pleasant things beside.
The woods were full of flowers, and Annie
loved flowers dearly. Then there were the
beautiful pine forests themselves, with their
cool shades and fragrant smell. There was sunshine
too, and now and then a story, when
Aunty felt brighter than usual. The negroes
in the neighborhood were all fond of little
"Missy Annie." They would catch squirrels for
her, or climb for birds' eggs; and old Sambo
scarcely ever passed the hut without bringing
some little gift of flowers or nuts. There was
Beppo, also, a large and handsome hound belonging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to a distant plantation, who came now
and then to make Annie visits. It was a case
of pure affection on his part, for she was not
allowed to give him any thing to eat, not even
a piece of corn bread, for food was too precious
with the stricken family to be shared with dogs.
But Beppo came all the same, and seemed to
like to race and romp with Annie just as well as
though the entertainment had wound up with
something more substantial. Oh! there were
many pleasant things to do, Annie thought.</p>

<p>When Aunty went out to call her that day,
she was sitting under a tree with a lap full of
yellow jessamines, which she was tying into a
bunch. As she worked she sang.</p>

<p>"Who are those for, Annie?" asked Miss
Pickens.</p>

<p>"I was going to give them to Mrs. Randolph,
Aunty. She came yesterday to the camp, Juba
says. I thought she'd like them."</p>

<p>Miss Pickens looked rigid, but she made
no reply. "The Camp" was a dep&ocirc;t of United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
States supplies, established for the relief of the
poor blacks and whites of the region, and Major
Randolph was the officer in charge of it. In her
great poverty, Miss Pickens had been forced to
apply with the rest of her neighbors for this aid,
going every week with a basket on her arm,
and receiving the same rations of bacon and
corn-meal which the poorest negroes received.
It was bitter bread; but what can one do when
one is starving? Major Randolph was sorry
for the poor lady, and kind and courteous
always, but Miss Pickens could not be grateful;
he was one of the Northern invaders who had
helped to crush her hopes and that of her State,
and to bring them to this extremity; and though
she took the corn-meal, she had no thanks in
her heart.</p>

<p>"We are going to the village this afternoon,
aren't we, Aunty?" went on Annie.</p>

<p>"Yes, we must," replied her Aunt. "I came
to tell you to get ready. And, Annie, don't sing
so loud when you are near the house. Grandmamma
doesn't like to hear it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doesn't she?" said Annie wondering. "I'll
try to remember, Aunty. But sometimes I
don't know when I am singing. It just sings of
itself."</p>

<p>"Getting ready" consisted of tying on two
faded, flapping sun-bonnets, to which Miss Pickens
added an old ragged India shawl, relic of
past grandeur. Annie's feet were bare, her
Aunt wore army shoes made of cow-skin, part
of the Bureau supply. She was a tall, thin
woman, and, with the habit of former days, carried
her head high in air as she walked along.
Little fairy Annie danced by her side, now stopping
to gather a flower, now to listen to a bird,
chatting and laughing all the way, as though
she were a bird herself, and never heeding
Aunty's melancholy looks or short answers.</p>

<p>"Who <i>are</i> those people?" asked Mrs. Randolph
of her husband, as she watched the odd-looking
pair come along the road. "Do look,
Harry. Such a strange woman, and&mdash;I do
declare, the prettiest child I ever saw in my
life. Tell me who they are?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's my little pet, Annie Pickens,"
replied the Major. Then he hastily told his
wife the story.</p>

<p>"The poor ladies suffer dreadfully both in
pride and in pocket, I fear," he added. "But
Annie, bless her! she doesn't know what suffering
means, any more than if she were a bird or
a squirrel. I thought you'd take a fancy to her,
Blanche; and perhaps you can think of some
way to help them. Women know how to set
about such things. I'm such a clumsy fellow
that all I dared attempt was to deal out as much
meal and bacon as the Aunt could carry."</p>

<p>Blanche Randolph found it easy to "take a
fancy" to the sweet little creature who lifted to
her such beaming eyes as she made her offering
of the yellow jessamines. "Oh, dear!" she said
to herself, "how I wish she belonged to me."
She kissed and fondled her, and while Miss
Pickens transacted her business, Annie sat on
Mrs. Randolph's lap and talked to her, quite as
though they were old acquaintances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you do all day, dear? Have you
any one to play with?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have Beppo. That's Mr. Ashley's
dog, you know. He runs over to see me
almost every week, and we have such nice
times."</p>

<p>"And don't you study any lessons?" asked
Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"No, not now. I used to, but Aunty is so
busy now that she says she hasn't time to teach
me. Beside, all my books were burned up."</p>

<p>"Come, Annie, it is time to go," said Miss
Pickens, moving away, with a curt bow to
Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>Annie lingered to kiss her new friend.</p>

<p>"I shall pick you some fresh flowers next
time we come," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Harry," said Mrs. Randolph,
"that is the most <i>pathetically</i> sweet little
darling I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Pathetic? Why she's as happy as the day
is long."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, you don't understand! That's the very
reason. 'I feel to cry' over her, as old Mauma
Sally would say."</p>

<p>Medville was a quiet, lonely place. All the
people, black and white alike, were very poor.
Nobody called to see Mrs. Randolph; there were
no parties to go to; and after a while she learned
to look forward to little Annie's visit as the
pleasantest thing in the whole week. Annie
looked forward to it also. Her new friend was
both kind and gay. Always some little treat
was prepared for her coming,&mdash;a book, a parcel
of cakes, or a picture-paper with gay colored
illustrations. Mrs. Randolph chose these gifts
carefully, because she was afraid of offending
Miss Pickens, but Miss Pickens was not offended;
she loved Annie too dearly for that, and became
almost gracious as she thanked Mrs. Randolph
for her kindness. After some time Mrs. Randolph
ventured to walk out to the cottage.
What she saw there horrified her, but I can
best tell what that was by quoting a letter which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
she wrote about that time to her sister, Mrs.
Boyd, who was spending the summer in England:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fancy, dear Mary, a miserable log hut not
one bit better than those in which the negroes
dwell. In fact, it used to be a negro hut, some
say a pig-pen; but that is too bad, I cannot
believe it. The roof lets in water, the floor is
broken away, the windows are stuffed with rags
and an old hat. Every thing is perfectly clean
inside, swept and scrubbed continually by the
poor ladies, and they are real ladies, Mary. It
was pitiful to see old Mrs. Pickens sitting in her
wooden chair in a dress which her former cook
would have disdained, and yet with all the dignity
and sad politeness of a duchess in difficulties.
They make no secret of their extreme
poverty; they cannot, in fact, for it stares you
in the face; but they ask for nothing, and you
would scarcely dare to offer aid. I was so
shocked that I could not restrain my tears. Miss
Pickens brought me a tin cupful of water, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
I think my sympathy touched her, for she has
thawed a little since, and has permitted Annie
to accept a gingham frock which I made for
her, and some stockings and shoes. Such dainty
little feet as hers are, and such a lovely child!
I have scarcely ever seen one so beautiful, and
it is not common beauty, but of the rarest sort,
with elegance and refinement in every feature
and movement. It is a thousand pities that she
should be left here to grow up in poverty without
education, or any of the things she was born
to, for, as I told you in my last, the family was
once wealthy, and Annie herself would be a
great heiress had not the war ruined them
all."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Boyd received this letter, she was
making a visit to some friends who lived in a
villa on the banks of the Thames. Mr. and Mrs.
Grant were the names of these friends. They
were all sitting on the lawn when the post came
in. The sunset cast a pink glow on the curves
of the beautiful river; the roses were in perfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
bloom; overhead and underfoot the grass and
trees were of that rich and tender green which
is peculiar to England. The letter interested
Mrs. Boyd so much that she read it aloud to
her friends, who were rich and kind-hearted
people, with one little boy of their own.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant almost cried over the letter. It
was the saddest thing that she had ever heard
of, and all that evening she and her husband
could talk of nothing else. Little Annie, sound
asleep in her Carolina cabin, did not dream that,
three thousand miles away, two people, whom
she had never heard of, were spending half the
night in the discussion of her fate and fortunes!
Long after their guest had gone to bed, the
Grants sat up together conversing about Annie;
and in the morning they came down with a
proposal so astonishing, that Mrs. Boyd could
hardly believe her ears when she heard it.</p>

<p>"We have been talking in a vague way for
years past of adopting a little girl," said Mr. Grant.
"We always wished for a daughter, and felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
sure that to have a sister would be the best thing
in the world for Rupert, who is an affectionate
little fellow, and would enjoy such a playmate of
all things. But you can easily guess that there
have been difficulties in the way of these plans,
especially as to finding the right child, so we
have done nothing about it. Now it strikes my
wife, and it strikes me also, that this story of
your sister's is a clear leading of Providence.
Here is a child who wants a home, and here are
we who want a child. So we have made up our
minds to send to America for Annie, and, if her
relatives will consent, to adopt her as our own.
Will you give me Mrs. Randolph's exact address?"</p>

<p>"But it is so sudden. Are you sure you won't
repent?" asked Mrs. Boyd.</p>

<p>"I don't think we shall. And it seems less
sudden to us than to you, because, as I have explained,
this idea has been in our minds for a
a long time."</p>

<p>You can fancy the excitement of Major<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and Mrs. Randolph when Mr. Grant's letter
reached Medville. He offered to adopt Annie,
and treat her in every respect as though she
were his own daughter, provided her Grandmother
and Aunt would give her up entirely,
and promise never again to claim her as theirs.</p>

<p>"If they will consent to this," wrote Mr. Grant,
"I will settle a hundred pounds a year on them
for the rest of their lives. I will also employ a
lawyer to see if any thing can be done towards
getting back a part of the confiscated property.
But all this is only on condition that the child
is absolutely made over to me. I am not
willing to take her with any loop-hole left open
by which she may, by and by, be claimed back
again just as we have learned to consider her
our own. I beg that Major Randolph will have
this point most clearly understood, and will
attend to the drawing up of a legal paper which
shall put it beyond the possibility of dispute."</p>

<p>The day after this letter came, Mrs. Randolph
put it in her pocket and walked out to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
mountain hut. She felt very nervous as she
tapped at the door.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible thing to do," she wrote
afterwards to her sister. "There were the two
poor ladies as stately as ever, and little Annie so
bright and winning. It was like asking for the
only happy thing left in their lives. I explained
first about my letter to you, and how you happened
to be staying with the Grants when you
received it, and then I gave Miss Pickens Mr.
Grant's letter. Her face was like iron as she
read it, and she swallowed hard several times,
but she never uttered one word. When she
had done, she thought for several minutes;
then she said, in a choked voice, 'If you will
leave this with us, Madam, you shall have an
answer to-morrow.' I came away. Dear little
Annie walked half way down the hill with me.
I hope, oh, so much, that they will let her go.
The life they lead is too sad for such a child,
and in every way it is better for them all; but
oh, dear! I am so sorry for them that I don't
know what to do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day Miss Pickens walked down alone
to the Relief Station.</p>

<p>"My mother and I have talked it over,"
she said briefly, "and we have decided. Annie
must go."</p>

<p>"I am glad," said Mrs. Randolph. "Glad for
her, but very sorry for you."</p>

<p>"It is like cutting out my heart," said the
poor Aunt. "But what can we do? I am not
able to give the child proper food even, or
decent clothes. If we keep her she must grow
up in ignorance. These English strangers offer
every thing; we have nothing to offer. If we
could count on the bare necessaries of life,&mdash;no
more than those,&mdash;I would never, never
give up Annie. As it is, it would be sinning
against her to refuse."</p>

<p>"Mr. Grant's assistance will do much to make
your own lives more comfortable," suggested
Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"I don't care about that. We could go on
suffering and not say a word, if only we might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
keep Annie. But she would suffer too, and
more and more as she grows older. No, Annie
must go."</p>

<p>"The Grants are thoroughly good people,
and will be kindness itself, I am sure. The only
danger is that they may spoil your dear little
girl with over-indulgence."</p>

<p>"She can stand a good deal, having had none
for so long a time," replied Miss Pickens with
a sad smile. "But Annie is not that sort of
child; nothing could spoil her. When must she
go, Mrs. Randolph?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Grant spoke of the 'Cuba,' on which
some friends of his are to sail. She leaves on
the 24th."</p>

<p>"The 24th. That is week after next."</p>

<p>"If it seems to you too soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. The sooner it is over the better for us
all."</p>

<p>"I half feel as if I had done you a wrong,"
said Mrs. Randolph, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, you have done us no wrong. It is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
our own hands, you see. We could say no,
even now. Oh, if I dared say it! But I dare
not,&mdash;that is worst of all,&mdash;I dare not." She
gave a dry sort of sob and walked away rapidly.
Mrs. Randolph, left behind, broke down and indulged
in a good fit of crying.</p>

<p>Dear little Annie! she was partly puzzled,
partly pleased, partly pained by the news of
what was going to befall her. She clung to
her Aunty, and declared that she could not go.
Then Mrs. Randolph talked with her and explained
that Aunty would be better off, and
Grandmamma have a more comfortable house
to live in&mdash;making pictures of the sweet
English home, the kind people, the dear little
brother waiting for her on the other side of the
sea, till Annie felt as if it would be pleasant to
go. There was not much time for discussion;
every thing was done in a hurry. Mrs. Randolph
sewed all day long on her machine, making
little underclothes and a pretty blue travelling
dress. Miss Pickens patched up one of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
faded silks, for she was to accompany Annie to
New York and see her sail, Mr. Grant paying
all the expenses of the journey for both of them.
Grandmamma cried all night, but in the daytime
her face looked set and hard. There were
papers to sign and boxes to pack. Beppo
seemed to smell in the air that something was
about to happen. All day long he hung around
the hut, whining and sniffing. Now and then he
would throw back his head and give a long,
sorrowful bay, which echoed from some distant
point in the pine wood. The last day came,&mdash;the
last kisses. It was like a rapid whirling
dream, the journey, the steam cars, the arrival
in New York, and Annie only seemed to wake
up when she stood on the steamer's deck and
felt the vessel throb and move away. On the
wharf, among the throng of people who had
come down to say good-by, stood Aunty's tall
figure in her faded silk and ragged shawl, looking
so different from any one else there. She
did not wave her handkerchief or make any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
sign, but fixed her eyes on Annie as if she
could never look away, and there was something
in the expression of her face which made
Annie suddenly burst into tears. She wiped
them fast, but before she could see clearly, the
wharf was far distant, and Aunty's face was
only a white spot among other white spots,
which were partly faces and partly fluttering
handkerchiefs. A few minutes more and the
spots grew dim, the wharf could no longer be
seen, the vessel began to rock and plunge in
the waves, and the great steamer was fairly at
sea.</p>

<p>Do you suppose that Annie cried all the
voyage? Bless you, no! It was not in her
to be sorrowful long. In a very little while
her tears dried, smiles came back, and the trustful
brown eyes were as bright as ever. Everybody
on board noticed the dear little girl and
was kind. The Captain, who had little girls of
his own at home, would walk with her on the
deck for an hour at a time, telling her stories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which he called "yarns," and which were very
interesting. The old sailors would coax the
little maiden amidships and tell her "yarns"
also, about sharks and whales and albatrosses.
One of them was such a nice old fellow. His
name was "Jack," and he won Annie's affections
completely, by catching a flying-fish in a
bucket and making her a present of it. Did
you ever see a flying-fish? Annie's did not
seem at all happy in the bucket, so she threw
him into the sea again, but none the less was
she pleased that Jack gave him to her. She
liked to watch the porpoises turn and wheel in
the water, and the gulls skim and dive; but
most of all she delighted in the Mother Carey's
chickens, which on stormy days fluttered in and
out, rocking on the waves, and never seeming
afraid, however hard the wind might blow.
Going to sea was to Annie as pleasant as all
the other pleasant things in her life. She
would have laughed hard enough had anybody
asked whether unpleasant things had never happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to her, and would have said "No!" in a
minute.</p>

<p>The voyage ended at Liverpool. Annie felt
sorry and homesick at leaving the vessel, as
travellers are apt to do. But pretty soon a
gentleman came on board, and a pretty little
boy. It was Mr. Grant and Rupert, come down
to meet her, and they were so pleasant and so
glad to see Annie that she forgot all her home-sickness
at once.</p>

<p>"What a funny carriage," she exclaimed,
when, after they had all landed, Mr. Grant
helped her into a cab.</p>

<p>"It's a Hansom," explained Rupert. "Papa
engaged one because I asked him. It's such
fun to ride in 'em, I think. Don't they have
any in America where you live?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;not any carriages at all where I live,"
replied Annie, nestling down among the cushions,&mdash;"only
mule carts and&mdash;wheelbarrows&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
yes&mdash;Major Randolph had an ambulance.
There were <i>beau</i>-tiful carriages in New York
though, but I didn't see any like this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes,&mdash;very much," replied Annie, cuddling
cosily between her new Papa and Brother.</p>

<p>"Isn't she pretty?" whispered Rupert to his
father. "None of the other fellows at our
school have got such a pretty sister as she is.
And she's a jolly little thing, too," he added
confidentially.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant had grown a little anxious about
the first meeting. "If we <i>should</i> be disappointed!"
she thought. But when the carriage
drove up and her husband lifted Annie out, a
glance made her easy. "I can love that child,"
she said to herself, and her embrace was so warm
that Annie rested in her arms with the feeling
that here was real home and a real Mamma,
and that England was just as nice as America.</p>

<p>You can guess how she enjoyed the lawn
with its roses, and the beautiful river. Fresh
from the poor little cabin on the hill-top, she
nevertheless fell with the greatest ease into the
ways and habits of her new life. It did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
puzzle or disturb her in the least to live in large
rooms, be waited on by servants, or have nice
things about her; she took to all these naturally.
For a few days Mr. and Mrs. Grant watched
with some anxiety, fearing to discover a flaw
in their treasure, but no flaw appeared. Not
that Annie was faultless, but hers were honest
little faults; there was nothing hidden or concealed
in her character, and in a short time her
new friends had learned to trust her and to love
her entirely.</p>

<p>So here was our little girl fairly settled in
England, with dainty dresses to wear, a governess
coming every day to give her lessons, masters
in French and music, a carriage to ride in,
and half a dozen people at least ready to pet and
make much of her all the time. Do you think
she was happier than she had been before?
How could she be? One cannot be more than
happy. She was happy then, she was happy
now,&mdash;no more, no less.</p>

<p>Rupert used to talk to her sometimes about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that old life, which seemed to him so strange
and dismal.</p>

<p>"How you must have hated it!" he said
once. "I can't bear to have you tell me any
more. What's corn-meal? It sounds very
nasty! And didn't you have anybody to play
with, not anybody at all, or any fun, ever?"</p>

<p>"Fun!" cried Annie; "I should think so!
Why, Rupert, our woods were full of squirrels.
Such dear little things!&mdash;you never saw such
pretty squirrels. One of them got so tamed
that he used to eat out of my hand. His name
was Torpedo. I named him myself. Then
there was Beppo, the dearest dog! I wish you
knew him. We used to run races and have the
greatest fun. And Aunty and I had nice times
going down to the camp."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" sighed Rupert. He
could not see the fun at all.</p>

<p>When Annie had been three years with the
Grants, Major and Mrs. Randolph came to London,
and drove down to the villa to see her. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
was a great pleasure to them all. Annie had a
thousand questions to ask about Grandmamma
and Aunty, who no longer lived in the hut, but
in Medville, where Mr. Grant had hired a small
house for them.</p>

<p>"They are quite comfortable now," said Mrs.
Randolph. "Aunty has gained a little flesh, and
Grandmamma is stronger, and able to walk out
sometimes. Old Sambo came down the very
night before we left with a box of birds' eggs,
which he wished to send to 'Missy Annie.' They
are in the carriage; you shall have them presently.
And here is a long letter from Aunty."</p>

<p>"Annie, you look just the same," remarked
the Major; "only you are grown, and the sunburn
has worn off and left you as fair as a lily.
You used to be brown as a bun when I knew
you first. I needn't ask if you are happy here?"</p>

<p>"Oh! very, very happy," said Annie warmly.</p>

<p>"A great deal happier than you were when
you lived with Grandmamma and Aunty?"
inquired Mrs. Randolph.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no!" cried Annie wonderingly; "not
any happier than <i>that</i>. I used to have lovely
times then; but I have lovely times here too."</p>

<p>"That child will never lack for happiness,"
said the Major, as they drove back to London.
"She's the brightest little being I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied his wife; "rain or shine, it's
all one with Annie. Her cheer comes from
within, and is so warm and radiant that, whatever
sky is overhead, she always rejoices. Let
the clouds do what they may, it makes no difference:
Annie will always sit in the sun,&mdash;the
sunshine of her own sweet, happy little heart."</p>

<p>"<span class='smcap'>Now</span>, Dinah, it's time to try the jelly."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Miss May; it can't be stiff
yet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Dinah, it is; I think it is. I'll
only just breathe on it, Dinah; I'll not disturb
it a bit."</p>

<p>"Let me breathe on it too."</p>

<p>"And me."</p>

<p>Dinah chuckled silently to herself in a way
she had. She opened the kitchen window, and
in one second three little girls had climbed on
three chairs, and three curly heads had met over
the saucer of currant juice which stood on the
sill.</p>

<p>"I <i>think</i> it's going to jelly," said May.</p>

<p>Lulu touched it delicately with the point of
her small forefinger.</p>

<p>"There!" she cried triumphantly. "It <i>crinkled</i>;
it did, Dinah! The jelly's come."</p>

<p>"Oh, how good!" added Bertha, applying
her finger, not so gently, to the hot surface,
and then putting it into her mouth to cool it!
"It's the bestest jelly we ever made, Dinah."</p>

<p>Dinah chuckled again at this "we." But,
after all, why not? Had not the children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
watched her scald and squeeze the currants, and
stir and skim? Had not May wielded the big
wooden spoon for at least three minutes? Had
not Lulu eaten a mouthful of skimmings on the
sly? Were they not testing the product now?
The little ones had surely a right to say "we,"
and Dinah accepted the partnership willingly.
She lifted the preserving kettle on to the table;
and the junior (not silent!) members of the
firm mounted on their chairs, watched with
intense interest as she dipped the glasses in hot
water, and filled each in turn with the clear red
liquid.</p>

<p>"It's first-rate jell," she remarked. "Be
hard in no time."</p>

<p>"Put a tiny, tiny bit in my doll's tumbler,"
said Bertha, producing a minute vessel. "She
likes jelly very much, my dolly does."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it nice to cook!" exclaimed Lulu,
jumping up and down in her chair! "Such fun!
I wish Mamma'd always let us do it."</p>

<p>"What shall we make next?" asked May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jumbles," responded the senior partner
briefly.</p>

<p>"I like to make jumbles," cried May. "I
may cut out all the diamond-shaped ones,
mayn't I, Di?"</p>

<p>"And I, all the round ones?"</p>

<p>"And I, the hearts?"</p>

<p>Dinah nodded. The children got down from
their chairs, and ran to the closet. They came
back each with a tin cookie-pattern in her
hand. Dinah sifted flour and jumbled egg and
sugar rapidly together, with that precise carelessness
which experience teaches. In a few
minutes the smooth sheet of dough lay glistening
on the board, and the children began cutting
out the cakes; first a diamond, then a heart,
then a round, each in turn. As fast as the shapes
were cut, Dinah laid them in baking-tins, and carried
them away to the oven. The work went
busily on. It was great fun. But, alas! in the
very midst of it, interruption came. The door
opened, and a lady walked in,&mdash;a pretty lady in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a beautiful silk gown of many flounces. When
she saw what the children were doing, she
frowned, and did not seem pleased.</p>

<p>"My dears," she said, "I was wondering
where you were. It is quite time that you
should be dressed for the afternoon. Come
upstairs at once."</p>

<p>"O Mamma!&mdash;we're helping Dinah. Mayn't
we stay and finish?"</p>

<p>"Helping? Nonsense! Hindering, you mean.
Dinah will be glad to get rid of you. Come at
once."</p>

<p>May got down from her chair. But Lulu and
Bertha pouted.</p>

<p>"We've hung all our dolls' things out on
the line," they said. "It's washing-day in the
baby-house, Mamma. Mayn't we stay just a
little while to clap and fold up?"</p>

<p>"Clap and fold," exclaimed Mrs. Frisbie.
"Where do you pick up such words, I wonder.
Of course you can't stay, you must come and
be made decent. Susan shall finish your dolls'
wash."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! please Mamma, it's so much nicer
to do 'em ourselves," pleaded Lulu. "Don't let
Susan touch them. We love so to wash. Dinah
says we're worth our wages, we do it so
well."</p>

<p>"Dinah should not say such things," said
Mrs. Frisbie, severely, leading the unwilling
flock upstairs. "Now, Lulu, do look pleasant.
I really cannot have all this fuss made each
time that I tell you to come and sit with me
and behave like little ladies. This passion for
house-work is vulgar; I don't like it at all.
With plenty of servants in the house, and your
Pa's money, and all, there's no need that you
should know any thing about such common
doings. Now, go upstairs and tell Justine to
put on your French cambrics and your sashes,
and when you're ready come straight down. I
want you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbie went into the drawing-room as
she spoke, and shut the door behind her with a
little bang. She was a good-natured woman in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the main, but at that moment she was really
put out. Why should <i>her</i> children have this
outlandish taste for cooking and washing? <i>She</i>
liked to be beautifully dressed, and sit on a sofa
doing nothing. Why shouldn't they like to do
the same? It was really too bad, she thought.
The children were not a bit like her. They
were "clear Frisbie straight through," and it
was really a trial. She felt quite unhappy, and,
as I said, gave the door a bang to relieve her
feelings.</p>

<p>While the children are putting on their French
cambrics, I will tell you a Fairy story.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, in a wonderful country
where all the inhabitants are Kings and Queens,
a little Prince was born. His father's kingdom
was not big, being only a farm-house, two clover
fields, and a potato patch, but none the less was
it a kingdom, because no one else had right to
it or could dispute it. The Prince was born on a
Sunday, and the Fairy who has charge of Sunday
children came and stood by his cradle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall be lucky always," she said, touching
the baby's soft cheek with the point of her
finger. "I give you four gifts, Sunday Prince.
The first is a strong and handsome body,"&mdash;and
the Fairy, as she spoke, stroked the small limbs
with her wand. "The next is a sweet temper.
The third is a brave heart&mdash;you'll need it, little
Prince,&mdash;all people do in this world. Lastly,"&mdash;and
the Fairy touched the sleeping eyelids
lightly,&mdash;"I give you a pair of clear, keen eyes,
which shall tell you the difference between hawks
and hernshaws from the very beginning. This
gift is worth something, as you'll soon find out.
Now, good-by, my baby. Sleep well, and grow
fast. Here's a pretty plaything for you,"&mdash;taking
from her pocket a big, beautiful bubble,
and tossing it in the air. "Run fast," she said,
"blow hard, follow the bubble, catch it if you
can; but, above all things, keep it flying. Its
name is Fortune,&mdash;a pretty name. All the little
boys like to run after my bubbles. As long as it
keeps up, up, all will go brightly; but if you fail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to blow, or blow unwisely, and it goes down,
down&mdash;well&mdash;you'll be lucky either way, my
Sunday Prince; 'tis I who say so." Thereupon
the Fairy kissed the sleeping child and vanished.</p>

<p>Only the clear eyes of the little Prince could
see the rainbow bubble which hung in air above
his head, and flew before, wherever he went.
He began to see it when still very young, and
as he grew bigger he saw it more clearly still.
And he blew, blew, and the gay bubble went up,
up, and all things prospered. Before long, the
baby Prince was a man, and took possession of
his kingdom; for in this wonderful country
plenty of kingdoms are to be had, and Princes are
not forced to wait until their fathers die before
taking possession of their crowns. So, being a
grown Prince, he began to look about for a
Princess to share his throne with him. And he
found a very nice little one; who, when he asked
her, made a courtesy and said, "Yes, thank you,"
in the prettiest way possible. Then the Prince
was pleased, and sent for a priest. The priest's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
name was Slack. He belonged to the Methodist
persuasion, Otsego Conference, but he married
the Prince and the Princess just as well as
though he had been an archbishop. They went
to live in a small palace of their own, and
after awhile some little princelings came to live
with them, and they were all very happy
together. And the lucky Prince, being fairy-blessed,
kept on being lucky. The rainbow
bubble flew before; he blew strongly, wisely; it
soared high, high, and all things prospered.
His kingdom increased, his treasure-bags were
filled with gold. By and by the little palace
grew too small for them, or they fancied it so,
and another was built, a real palace this time,
with lawns, and fish-ponds, and graperies, and
gardens. The only trouble was&mdash;</p>

<p>But here come the children downstairs, so I
must drop into plain prose, and tell you what
already you have guessed, that the Prince I
mean is their father, John Frisbie,&mdash;Prince John,
if you like,&mdash;and the Princess's name was Mary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Jones before she was married, but now, of course,
it is Mary Frisbie. There were five of the
princelings,&mdash;Jack and May and Arthur and
Lulu and Bertha. The new palace was a beautiful
house, with wide, lovely grounds. But since
they came to live in it, Mrs. Frisbie had taken
it into her head that so fine a house required
manners to match, and that the things the
children liked best, and had been allowed to
do in the small house, were vulgar, and might
not be permitted now. This was a real trouble
to the little ones, for, as their mother said, they
were "clear Frisbie all through;" and the thrift,
energy, cleverness, and other qualities by which
their father had made his fortune, were strong
in them. Perhaps the Fairy had visited their
cradles also. Who knows?</p>

<p>The girls came down crisp and fresh in their
ruffled frocks, with curls smoothed, sashes tied,
and their company dolls in their hands.</p>

<p>"Now sit down and be comfortable," said
Mrs. Frisbie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Dear me, what a number of meanings there
are to that word "comfortable"! Mrs. Frisbie
thought it meant pretty clothes, pretty rooms,
and nothing to do. To the boys it took the
form of hard, hearty work of some sort. Papa
understood it as a cool day in his office, business
brisk, but not too brisk, and an occasional cigar.
May, Lulu, and Bertha would have translated
it thus: "our old ginghams and our own
way;" while Dinah, if asked, would have defined
"comfort" as having the kitchen "clar'd
up" after a successful bake, and being free to
sit down, darn stockings, and read the "Illustrated
Pirate's Manual," a newspaper she much
affected on account of the blood-thirstiness of
its pictures. None of these various explanations
of the word mean the same thing, you see.
And the drollest part is that no one can ever be
made "comfortable" in any way but his own:
that is impossible.</p>

<p>The company dolls were very fine ladies indeed;
they came from Paris, and had trunks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
full of splendid dresses. The children did not
care much for them, and liked better certain
decrepit babies of rag and composition, which
were thought too shabby to be allowed in the
parlor.</p>

<p>"Where are the boys?" asked Mrs. Frisbie,
when the small sisters had settled themselves.</p>

<p>"Jack was going to have his sale this afternoon,"
replied Mary. "And Arthur is auctioneer."</p>

<p>"His sale! What on earth is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mamma&mdash;don't you know? Jack's
chickens, of course. Croppy had eleven and
Top-knot nine. There's a 'corner' in chickens
just now, Arthur says, because most of the other
boys have lost theirs. Alfred's were sick and
died, and the rats ate all of Charley Ross's, and
a hawk carried off five of Howard's. Jack expects
to make a lot of money, because Croppy
is a Bramahpootra hen, you know, and her
chicks are very valuable."</p>

<p>"Corner! Lot of money! Oh, dear!" sighed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
poor Mrs. Frisbie, "what words the boys do
teach you. Where they learn them I can't
imagine. Not from me."</p>

<p>"From Papa, I guess," explained Lulu innocently.
"He used to have hens when he was
little, and sell 'em. It was splendid fun, he
says. Grandmamma thinks that Jack is just
Papa over again."</p>

<p>"All of you are," said Mrs. Frisbie. "Not
one of you is a bit like me. Can't you sit still,
Bertha? What <i>are</i> you doing there with your
handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"Only dusting the table leg, Mamma; it
wasn't quite clean."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! and in your nice frock. Do let
the furniture alone, child. Ring for Bridget, if
any thing wants cleaning. You're a real Meddlesome
Matty, Bertha."</p>

<p>"O Mamma!" cried Bertha, aggrieved.
"Grandmamma taught me to dust when we
lived in the other house, you know. Grandmamma
said it was a good thing for little girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to be useful. And I didn't meddle with any
thing on the table; really I didn't, Mamma."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," said Mrs. Frisbie. "It's
no great matter, only I don't like to have you do
such things. Now sit still and play with your
doll." She opened a book and began to read.
The children crept nearer to each other and
talked in low whispers.</p>

<p>"Let's play that Eugenie and Victoria are
little girls come to make each other a visit, and
Isabella is their Mamma."</p>

<p>"You can't! Little girls never have trains
to their dresses or necklaces."</p>

<p>"Oh! I wish Nippy Scatch-Face and old Maria
were down here," sighed Lulu.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," put in May. "We'll play they
are three stiff old ladies, who always wear best
clothes, you know, and sit so in chairs; and that
Nippy and Maria are coming to make them a
visit. They needn't really come, you know.
Mrs. Eugenie, sit up straight. Now listen to the
hateful old thing! She's talking to Victoria."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sister, when are those children coming?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sister," squeaked back Lulu
in the character of Victoria. "I wish they
wouldn't come at all. Children are the bane
of my existence."</p>

<p>"You horrid doll, talking that way about <i>my</i>
baby," cried Bertha, giving Victoria a shove.</p>

<p>"Don't, Beppie; you'll push her down," said
May. Then changing her voice again, "Your
manners is most awful, I'm sure," she squeaked,
in the person of the irate Victoria.</p>

<p>All the children giggled, and Mrs. Frisbie
looked up from her book.</p>

<p>At this moment in ran the two boys, hot,
dusty, and excited,&mdash;Arthur with a handful of
"fractional currency," and Jack waving a two-dollar
bill.</p>

<p>"See!" they cried. "Four dollars and sixty-five
cents. Isn't that splendid? Mr. Ashurst
bought all the Croppys, and gave twenty-five
cents a piece for them."</p>

<p>"Let us see, let us see!" cried the little girls,
precipitating themselves on the money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, now, Mary Frisbie&mdash;no snatching!"
protested Jack,&mdash;"I haven't told you
the best yet. Mr. Ashurst says we're such good
farmers, that he'll give us work whenever we
like to take it. He says I could earn three
dollars a week <i>now</i>! Think of that."</p>

<p>"Oh, how much!" cried Lulu, awe-struck.
"What could you do with so much, Jacky?"</p>

<p>"Now boys,&mdash;listen to me," said their mother.
"Go upstairs right away and get ready for tea.
You look like real farmers' boys at this moment,
I declare, so hot and dusty. I don't wonder
Mr. Ashurst offered you work,&mdash;though I think
it was very impertinent of him to do so. I hope
you said that your father's sons didn't need to
earn money in any such way."</p>

<p>"Why, Mamma, of course I didn't. Arthur
and me like to work, and we are going to somehow
just as soon as we're big enough. It's lots
better fun than going to school. Besides, Papa
says we may. He told us all American boys
ought to work, whether their fathers are rich or
poor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa likes to talk nonsense with you," said
Mrs. Frisbie, biting her lips. "Go up now and
dress."</p>

<p>There was a howl from both boys.</p>

<p>"O Mamma! not yet. It's too early for
that horrid dressing, oh, a great deal too early,
Mamma. We've got a lot to do in our chicken
house. Mayn't we go out again for a little
while, just for half an hour, Mamma?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;for half an hour you may," said
Mrs. Frisbie reluctantly, consulting her watch.
Away clattered the boys,&mdash;the girls looking
after them with envious eyes.</p>

<p>Presently Lulu slipped out and was gone a
few minutes. She came back sparkling, with
her cheeks very rosy.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she cried, "what <i>do</i> you think?
David says if you haven't any objections, we
may each of us have a little garden down there
behind the asparagus beds. He'll make them
for us, Mamma, he says, and we can plant just
what we like in them. O Mamma! don't have
any objections&mdash;please."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will he really?" cried May. "I'll put peppergrass
in mine,&mdash;and parsley. Dinah says
she never has as much parsley as she wants."</p>

<p>"Yes, and little green cucumbers," added
Bertha,&mdash;"little teeny-weeny ones, for pickles,
you know. Dinah is always wishing she could
get them, but David never sends in any but
big ones. O Mamma! do say yes. It'll be so
nice."</p>

<p>"Cucumbers! peppergrass! Well, you are
the strangest children! Why don't you have
pinks and pansies and pretty things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we will, and make bouquets for you,
Mamma; only we thought of the useful things
first."</p>

<p>"Somehow you always do think of useful
things first," murmured Mrs. Frisbie. "However,
have the gardens if you like. I'm sure I
don't care."</p>

<p>The children's thanks were cut short by the
click of a latch-key in the hall-door.</p>

<p>"There's Papa!" cried Bertha; and, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
three arrows dismissed from the string, the children
were off to greet him. It was always a
joy to have Papa come home.</p>

<p>He was looking grave as he opened the door,
but his face lit up at once at the sight of his
little girls. Papa's face without a smile upon it
would have seemed a strange sight indeed to
that household. It did cross May's mind that
evening that the smiles were not so merry as
usual, and that Papa seemed tired; but no one
else noticed it, either then or on the days that
followed.</p>

<p>Bubbles are pretty things, but the keeping
them in air grows wearisome after a while.
About this time the rainbow bubble set afloat
by the kind Fairy for the sleeping Prince began
to misbehave itself. Contrary winds seized it;
it flew wildly, now here, now there; and, instead
of sailing steadily, it was first up, then
down, then up again, but more down than up.
Prince John blew his hardest and did his best
to keep it from sinking; for he knew, as we all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
do, that once let a bubble touch the earth, and
all is over,&mdash;its glittering wings collapse,&mdash;they
fly no more.</p>

<p>So the weeks went on. Unconscious of
trouble, the children dug and planted in their
little gardens. Each new leaf and shoot was a
wonder and a delight to them. Bertha's plants
flourished less than the others, because of a
habit she had of digging them all up daily to
see how the roots were coming on; but, except
for that, all went well, and the bluest of skies
stretched itself over the heads of the small
gardeners. In the City, where Papa's office
was, the sky was not blue at all. High winds
were blowing, stormy black clouds shut out the
sun. Bubbles were sinking and bursting on
every side, and men's hearts were heavy and
anxious. Prince John did his best. He watched
his bubble anxiously, and followed it far. It
was fairy-blessed, as I said, and its wings were
stronger than bubble's wings usually are; but
at last the day came when it could soar no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
longer. The pretty shining sphere hovered,
sank, touched a rock, and in a minute&mdash;hey!
presto!&mdash;there was no bubble there; it had
utterly disappeared, and Prince Frisbie, with a
very sober face, walked home to tell his wife
that he had lost every thing they had in the
world. This was not a pleasant or an easy
thing to do, as you can readily imagine.</p>

<p>The children never forgot this evening. They
used to vaguely refer to it among themselves
as "That time, you know." Papa came in
very quiet and pale, and shut himself up with
Mamma. She&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;was much distressed,
and sobbed and cried. They heard her
as they came downstairs dressed for the evening,
and it frightened them. Papa, coming out
after a while, found them huddled together in
a dismayed little group in the corner of the
entry.</p>

<p>"O Papa! is it any thing dreadful?" asked
May. "Is Mamma sick?"</p>

<p>"No, not sick, darling, but very much troubled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
about something. Come with me and I will
explain it to you." Then Papa led them into
the dining-room; and, with Bertha on his knee
and the others close to him, he told them that
he had lost a great deal of money (almost all
he had), and they would have to sell the place,
and go and live in a little house somewhere,&mdash;he
didn't yet know exactly where.</p>

<p>The children had looked downcast enough
when Papa commenced, but at this point their
faces brightened.</p>

<p>"A really little house?" exclaimed May.
"O Papa! do you know, I'm glad. Little
houses are so pretty and cunning, I always
wanted to live in one. Susie Brown's Papa
does, and Susie can go into the kitchen whenever
she likes, and she toasts the bread for tea,
and does all sorts of things. Do you suppose
that I may toast the bread when we go to live
in our little house, Papa?"</p>

<p>"I daresay Mamma will be glad of your help
in a great many ways," replied Papa.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall we be poor, very poor indeed?" demanded
Bertha anxiously.</p>

<p>"Pretty poor for the present, I am afraid,"
replied her Father.</p>

<p>"Goody! goody!" cried May, hopping up
and down on her toes. "I always wanted to be
poor, it's so nice! We'll have the <i>best</i> times,
Papa; see if we don't!"</p>

<p>Papa actually laughed, May's happy, eager
face amused him so much.</p>

<p>"I know what we'll do," said Jack, who had
been considering the matter in silence. "We'll
raise lots of chickens, and give you all the
money, Papa."</p>

<p>"My boy, I am afraid you must give up your
chickens. There will be no place for them in
the new home."</p>

<p>"Must we?" Jack gave a little gulp, but
went on manfully, "Well, never mind, we'll
find something else that we can do."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ashurst says Jack is the 'handiest' boy
he ever saw, Papa," put in Arthur eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, handiness is a capital stock-in-trade.
Now, dears, one thing,&mdash;be as good and gentle
as possible with Mamma, and don't trouble her
a bit more than you can help."</p>

<p>"We will, we will," promised the little flock.
Mrs. Frisbie was quite right in saying that the
children took after their father. Their brave,
bright natures were as unlike hers as possible.</p>

<p>It is sad to see what short time it requires to
pull down and destroy a home which has taken
years to build. The Frisbies' handsome, luxurious
house seemed to change and empty all in
a moment. Carriages were sold, servants dismissed.
Furniture was packed and carried
away. In a few days nothing remained but a
fine empty shell, with a staring advertisement
of "For Sale" pasted on it. The familiar look
was all gone, and everybody was glad to get
away from the place. It took some time to
find the "little house," and some time longer
to put it to rights. Papa attended to all that,
the children remaining meanwhile with Grandmamma.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Mamma had taken to her bed with a
nervous attack, and cried day and night. Everybody
was sorry; they all waited on her, and did
their best to raise her spirits.</p>

<p>At last the new home was ready. It was
evening when the carriage set them down at
the gate, and they could only see that there
were trees and shrubs in the tiny front yard,
and a cheerful light streaming from the door,
where Dinah stood to welcome them,&mdash;dear
old Di, who had insisted on following their
fortunes as maid of all work. As they drew
nearer, they perceived that she stood in a small,
carpeted entry, with a room on either side.
The room on the right was a sitting-room; the
room on the left, a kitchen. There were three
bedrooms upstairs, and a small coop in the attic
for Dinah. That was all; for it was indeed a
"really little house," as Papa had said.</p>

<p>"Oh, how pretty!" cried Lulu, as she caught
sight of the freshly papered parlor, with its
cheerful carpet, and table laid for tea, and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the other hand of the glowing kitchen stove
and steaming kettle. "Such a nice parlor, and
the dearest kitchen. Why, it's smaller than
Susie Brown's house, which we used to wish
we lived in. Don't you like it, Mamma? I
think it's <i>sweet</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbie only sighed by way of reply.
But the children's pleasure was a comfort to
Papa. He and Dinah had worked hard to
make the little home look attractive. They
had papered the walls themselves, put up
shelves and hooks, arranged the furniture, and
even set a few late flowers in the beds, that the
garden might not seem bare and neglected.</p>

<p>The next day was a very busy one, for there
were all the trunks to unpack, and the bureau
drawers to fill, and places to be settled for this
thing and that. By night they were in pretty
good order, and began to feel at home, as people
always do when their belongings are comfortably
arranged about them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbie was growing less doleful. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
husband, who was very tired, lay back in a big
arm-chair. The evening was chilly, so Dinah
had lighted a small fire of chips, which flickered
and made the room bright. The glow danced
on Bertha's glossy curls as she sat at Mamma's
knee, and on the rosy faces of the two boys.
All looked cheerful and cosy; a smell of toast
came across the entry from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Bertha, your hair is very nicely curled to-night,"
said Mrs. Frisbie. "I don't know how
Dinah found time to do it."</p>

<p>"Dinah didn't do it, Mamma. May did it.
She did Lulu's too, and Lulu did hers. We're
always going to dress each other now."</p>

<p>Just then May came in with a plate of hot
toast in her hand. Lulu followed with the
teapot.</p>

<p>"It's so nice having the kitchen close by,"
said May, "instead of way off as it was in the
other house. This toast is as warm as&mdash;toast"&mdash;she
concluded, not knowing exactly how to
end her simile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your face looks as warm as toast, too,"
remarked her Father.</p>

<p>"Yes, Papa, that's because I toasted to-night.
Dinah was bringing the clothes from the lines,
so she let me."</p>

<p>"I stamped the butter, Papa," added Lulu.
"Look, isn't it a pretty little pat?"</p>

<p>"And I sifted the sugar for the blackberries,"
put in Bertha from her place at Mamma's knee.</p>

<p>"You don't mind, do you Mamma?" observed
Mary anxiously. "Di pinned a big
apron over my frock. See, it hasn't got a spot
on it."</p>

<p>"I'm glad she did," said Mrs. Frisbie, surprised.
"But it doesn't matter so much how
you dress here, you know. It was in the other
house I was so particular."</p>

<p>"But I like to please you, Mamma, and you
always want us to look nice, you know. We
mean to be very careful now, because if we
don't we shall worry you all the time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbie put her arm round Mary and
kissed her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare," she said, half-laughing, half-crying.
"This house <i>is</i> pleasant. It seems
snugger somehow, as if we were closer together
than we ever were before. I guess I shall like
it after all."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Prince John, rousing from
his fatigue at these comfortable words. "That's
right, Molly, dear! You don't know what good
it does me to hear you say so. If only you can
look bright and the chicks keep well and happy,
I shall go to work with a will, and the world will
come right yet." He smiled with a look of conscious
power as he spoke; his eyes were keen
and eager.</p>

<p>I think that just then, as the children gathered
round the table, as Mrs. Frisbie took up the teapot
and began to pour the tea, and her husband
pushed back his chair,&mdash;that just then, at that
very moment, the Fairy entered the room.
Nobody saw her, but there she was! She
smiled on the group; then she took from her
pocket another bubble, more splendid than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
one she had brought before, and tossed it into
the air above Prince John's head. "There,"
she said, "catch that. You'll have it this time,
and it won't break and go to pieces as the first
one did. Look at it sailing up, up, up,&mdash;this
bubble has wings, but it sails toward and not
away from you. Catch it, as I say, and make it
yours. But even when it <i>is</i> yours, when you
hold it in your hand and are sure of it, you'll
be no luckier and no happier, my lucky Prince,
than you are at this moment, in this small house,
with love about you, hope in your heart, and all
these precious little people to work for, and to
reward you when work is done."</p>
